1,"Boris Johnson’s 31 October “do or die” Brexit deadline appears to be out of reach. At Wednesday’s meeting with Jeremy Corbyn – and the pair’s chief advisers, Dominic Cummings and Seumas Milne, respectively – the government side expressed the hope that a new timetable could be agreed in time to leave by Halloween.Cummings reportedly indicated that MPs should be prepared to sit through the night, if that was what it would take.Boris Johnson has three options to try and call a general election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election may be called if it is agreed by two-thirds of the total number of MPs. Johnson presented motions for an election on 4 and 9 September and failed on both occasions when the majority of Labour MPs abstained. Johnson could try this again and potentially secure Labour backing, because the Benn act has removed the imminent possibility of a no-deal Brexit.This lowers the threshold of MPs needed to trigger a general election because it requires a simple majority to pass. This could work in Johnson’s favour. However, it is amendable, which can involve the moving of an election date to a time that works for the opposition. The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, can call a no-confidence motion in the prime minister. This needs a simple majority to pass. He has been urged to do this by Johnson several times as a way of triggering an election, but Corbyn has resisted. It begins a 14-day period in which either the prime minister or someone else can try to form a new government. While Johnson could potentially lose this, and therefore his place as prime minister, to another Conservative, Corbyn could also struggle to get enough MPs to rally around him to form a government. The Scottish National party has said it would back him, but the Liberal Democrats have been extremely vocal in saying they would not support him. An election is triggered if, at the end of the two-week period, no alternative government has been formed.Kate Proctor Political correspondentLabour believes meeting the deadline is now impractical, but that an alternative parliamentary timetable could easily be agreed – if the government just lets go of that talismanic date.So the prime minister must decide whether to press ahead with trying to push the withdrawal agreement bill through parliament, and “get Brexit done” before asking MPs to back a general election – or go to the voters now.Some of Johnson’s allies – particularly the bullish Vote Leave veterans inside Downing Street – believe the majority of 30 the government achieved on Tuesday for the second reading of his Brexit bill is as good as it gets.They have watched parliament delay and frustrate efforts to press ahead with Brexit for three years – not least when the Johnson resigned from Theresa May’s cabinet and voted against her deal twice.They fear that many of those 19 Labour MPs who rebelled against Corbyn to vote for the government could easily melt away later in the process. They could also succeed in allying with Conservative (and former Conservative) backbenchers to amend the legislation in ways Johnson, let alone the European Research Group, would find hard to stomach.And they believe Johnson’s moment of maximum electoral appeal may be now: with Labour divided about Brexit tactics, and the bounce of having secured a majority for the deal, albeit just at second reading.There is also the fact that without a majority, it will be extremely difficult for the prime minister to implement many of his policies.If he presses for an election now, Johnson will have to run on a platform of having been blocked by parliament from achieving what he promised to do – and there must be a risk that appears a weakness, not a strength.It may be hard to explain to voters why he didn’t just get on and get Brexit done; and it could open the way to a resurgent Brexit party.As May’s chief of staff, Gavin (now Lord) Barwell, tweeted on Thursday morning, “the Conservative party must be in a better place vs the Brexit party in any campaign if we have actually left”.It wasn’t May’s decision to delay Brexit – but her party was still hammered by Nigel Farage at May’s european elections.And Labour might fare better in an election in which they could focus on their domestic programme – and on promising to negotiate the closest possible trading relationship, and protect the rights and protections that would no longer be underpinned by EU legislation.If the EU27 signs off on the three-month extension as expected, the government could table a motion under the fixed-term parliament act to be voted on early next week.If it secures a two-thirds majority – which appears likely, with Labour preparing to back it – polling day would be five weeks after parliament is dissolved, making it just possible to cram in an election before Christmas.

61,"It’s not over. For a few anxious, or jubilant - depending on which tribe you belong to – minutes between 7.15pm and 7.30pm, it seemed as if the Brexit saga might just be on the verge of resolution, after three and a half agonisingly long years. The House of Commons voted to allow Boris Johnson’s withdrawal agreement bill to advance to the next stage, a prize that had eluded Theresa May not once, not twice, but three times.What’s more, MPs gave it a green light more emphatically than even the most ardent Brexiters had dared hope. While May had been crushed by triple-figure majorities, Johnson won his meaningful vote by 329 to 299 votes, a majority of 30. Put another way, and as if to reflect this divided nation through what have become the defining numbers of the Brexit era, he won by 52% to 48%.For a prime minister who lost his governing majority within days of reaching Downing Street, and who lost six of his first seven votes in the House, this tasted like a rare and substantial victory. All he had to do next was win approval for his accelerated timetable, one that would cram line-by-line scrutiny of a 110-page bill giving legal effect to a 585-page withdrawal agreement, into 48 hours. For a few fleeting, clammy-palmed moments, it seemed as if he might pull it off. The naysayers of the DUP remained in their seats. Did that mean they were they going to abstain, thereby handing Johnson a second win?It did not. They rose and walked through the no lobby, confirmation of their fury at a Tory prime minister who has done what he himself had said no Tory prime minister should ever do – agreeing to separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to such an extent that Northern Irish businesses will need to fill in customs forms to ship goods to their friends and cousins in England, Scotland and Wales. The result was defeat by 322 to 308 – all but 52-to-48 in reverse. Denied his fast track to approval, Johnson announced he was not pulling the bill – as he had threatened – but “pausing” it, as he waited to hear how long an extension the EU would grant to the Hamlet nation across the channel, forever paralysed by indecision.Posing as a man whose determination would not be deflected, Johnson said that we would “definitely be leaving the EU with this deal”. But note what he did not say: he dropped his customary reference to “by October the 31st”. For all the talk of corpses in ditches, and “do or die”, it was that promise that expired this evening.What does it mean? First, don’t fall for the hype that says that parliament approved Johnson’s deal. It did not. MPs simply voted for it to receive a second reading, some of them motivated by the desire not to endorse it but to amend it. As Labour’s Gloria De Piero confessed, she voted yes, “not because I support the deal but because I don’t”. That 30-vote majority will include MPs who wanted to propose UK membership of a customs union, others keen on conditioning the deal on public support in a confirmatory referendum. Screen out the Tory spin: those MPs should not be counted as backers of the deal.As for the defeat on the timetable, that is the result of what now looks like a tactical misjudgment by the government. By making such a fetish of the 31 October deadline – arbitrarily imposed by Emmanuel Macron when Theresa May missed the last one – Johnson painted himself into a corner whereby even a delay of a few days looked like a humiliation. Both Jeremy Corbyn and Ken Clarke signalled that it might not need much more than a few extra days to undertake the necessary scrutiny – though Nikki da Costa, until recently Johnson’s head of legislative affairs, had said it required at least four weeks – which is hardly that long to wait. Instead of taking that pragmatic course, Johnson felt compelled to call the whole thing to a halt.Why? The obvious explanation is that this gives the PM a pretext to grab what he really wants: an early election framed as a battle to get Brexit done, with him as the people’s tribune pitted against those wicked remainer saboteurs.But another explanation suggests itself, too. Any period of scrutiny is unpalatable to Johnson, because he fears that the threadbare coalition that might exist to back his deal will unravel once it engages in closer examination of the withdrawal agreement. Its erosion of workers’ rights; its creation of a new no-deal cliff edge in 2020; its entrenchment of a hard Brexit in law – all those dangers would only become more visible under the spotlight of protracted (or even normal) Commons scrutiny. Bits of his coalition – especially among those Labour MPs who backed him on Tuesday – would begin to flake off.The truth is, Johnson will never have a bigger vote for his deal in this House of Commons than the one he assembled tonight. It will only get smaller. No wonder he had to pause. His next option is to call an election – and gamble that the next parliament will be more forgiving than the last. Either way, we are not free of the Brexit saga yet, not by a long way.• Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",Don't buy the hype: Boris Johnson's Brexit deal did not win

75,"Boris Johnson could see his Brexit legislation amended to require him to negotiate a customs union with the EU, after at least five pro-deal MPs said they would support this option.The MPs – two former Conservatives, Nick Boles and Ken Clarke, plus at least three pro-deal Labour MPs, Melanie Onn, Gareth Snell and Ruth Smeeth – have put their names to a measure giving the government a mandate to negotiate a customs union.The amendment to the Brexit bill would not change the UK’s proposed treaty with the EU, so Johnson has the option of accepting the amendment and then going into an election arguing to overturn it.However, two Tory insiders told the Guardian it would be extremely difficult for Johnson and his Eurosceptic hardliners to accept any mandate for a customs union and it would be more likely for him to pull the bill and seek a general election.Johnson’s chances of passing the EU withdrawal agreement bill through the House of Commons are on a knife-edge.If at least five pro-deal MPs vote for it, then the chances of a customs union amendment passing later this week look fairly high. However, it could hinge on the actions of a handful of independents and the Democratic Unionist party, as well as the Liberal Democrats and SNP who have historically voted for remain and second referendum options rather than soft Brexit ones.Labour has said it will back an amendment in favour of a customs union and accepts that one proposed by backbenchers has the best chance of cross-party success.No 10 said Johnson would not accept a customs union. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, told the BBC now was not the time to discuss Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU and matters such as the customs union.“This is a piece of legislation which simply puts into effect in UK law what the prime minister has managed to negotiate. The critical thing is the future relationship will be subject to a negotiating mandate that will be debated and voted on in the House of Commons,” he said.“Those MPs who have concerns about issues such as that [the burden on businesses sending goods to Northern Ireland] or the customs union ... they will have the ability to discuss and vote on that later on, once we have left the European Union.’Jenrick added: “Those MPs who want to deliver Brexit will be voting with the government today.”",Pro-deal MPs try to force Johnson to seek EU customs union,2019-10-22/13:23:38,boris johnson could see his brexit legislation amended to require him to negotiate a customs union with the eu after at least five pro deal mps said they would support this option the mps two former conservatives nick boles and ken clarke plus at least three pro deal labour mps melanie onn gareth snell and ruth smeeth have put their names to a measure giving the government a mandate to negotiate a customs union the amendment to the brexit bill would not change the uk s proposed treaty with the eu so johnson has the option of accepting the amendment and then going into an election arguing to overturn it however two tory insiders told the guardian it would be extremely difficult for johnson and his eurosceptic hardliners to accept any mandate for a customs union and it would be more likely for him to pull the bill and seek a general election johnson s chances of passing the eu withdrawal agreement bill through the house of commons are on a knife edge if at least five pro deal mps vote for it then the chances of a customs union amendment passing later this week look fairly high however it could hinge on the actions of a handful of independents and the democratic unionist party as well as the liberal democrats and snp who have historically voted for remain and second referendum options rather than soft brexit ones labour has said it will back an amendment in favour of a customs union and accepts that one proposed by backbenchers has the best chance of cross party success no  said johnson would not accept a customs union robert jenrick the communities secretary told the bbc now was not the time to discuss britain s future trading relationship with the eu and matters such as the customs union this is a piece of legislation which simply puts into effect in uk law what the prime minister has managed to negotiate the critical thing is the future relationship will be subject to a negotiating mandate that will be debated and voted on in the house of commons he said those mps who have concerns about issues such as that the burden on businesses sending goods to northern ireland or the customs union they will have the ability to discuss and vote on that later on once we have left the european union jenrick added those mps who want to deliver brexit will be voting with the government today ,Brexit,0.34541285037994385
99,"Sajid Javid has rebuffed MPs’ demands for the Treasury to carry out a thorough economic assessment of the government’s Brexit deal, claiming it is “self-evidently in our economic interest”.The chancellor has written to MPs on the cross-party Treasury select committee, which requested a fresh analysis in order to help MPs judge whether to support the deal. Javid suggested ending the uncertainty that has surrounded the issue of Brexit would in itself be beneficial to the economy – and rejected the idea that the government should carry out a new analysis and then make it available to MPs.“My starting point is that agreeing the withdrawal agreement is self-evidently in our economic interest,” he said. “It would bring an end to the damaging uncertainty and delay of the past years and allow businesses to get on with taking decisions, including around recruitment and investment.”The cross-Whitehall economic analysis published last year suggested the economy would be considerably weaker under a free trade agreement (FTA) – the type of relationship targeted under Boris Johnson’s latest deal.But Javid said those forecasts only considered a “generic, ‘average’, FTA, looking at examples from around the world”. He suggested the shape of the UK’s FTA with the EU would only become clear during the course of the negotiations, once Brexit had happened.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “Flying blind on a massive decision on the future of the economy is no way for a government to make recommendations to parliament or make legislation. It’s preposterous behaviour by the chancellor and this government.”Independent analysis by the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank suggested Johnson’s plan would knock between 2.3% to 7% off GDP over the next decade, compared with remaining in the EU. The equivalent estimates for Theresa May’s deal were 1.9% to 5.5%.But in stark contrast to the cautious stance associated with his predecessor Philip Hammond, who was referred to by colleagues as “Spreadsheet Phil”, Javid played down the importance of economic forecasts for judging the value of the Brexit deal.“Trust in democracy, and bringing an end to the division that has characterised this debate over the past three years, is something that cannot be measured solely through spreadsheets or impact assessments, important though they are,” he wrote. “Respecting the referendum and closing this chapter so we can focus on delivering growth, and the public services people deserve, is the right thing to do for our country.”Anand Menon, the director of UK in a Changing Europe, said: “It is a shame that the chancellor seems to feel that evidence is now superfluous to good policy making. Self evidently there is more at stake here than just economics. That being said, surely we deserve to know the different potential implications of different kinds of Brexit?”Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “The chancellor is right to say lots of other things will affect what the economic outcome for Britain is. But what is true is that every major study done inside or outside government shows that a looser relationship with the EU, as envisaged in this agreement, leads to a smaller economy than it would otherwise be.”The full text of the withdrawal agreement bill, which the government hopes to rush through parliament in order to leave the EU on 31 October, is expected to be published on Monday evening.Javid is due to hold a budget on 6 November, if Brexit goes ahead next week, and the independent Office for Budget Responsibility will then present updated economic forecasts, though it is unclear whether they have enough time to analyse the details of the Johnson deal.In the Commons, Labour’s Ian Murray said he was unable to answer his constituents who ask about the impact Johnson’s deal would have on their finances because the Government is “refusing to publish an economic impact assessment”. Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay replied: “The answer is to listen to the Bank of England governor who says that getting this deal passed will be a boost to our economy.” Catherine McKinnell, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne North, said MPs were being “left in the dark” about the economic impact of the new Brexit deal. Responding, Barclay said: “The reality is that any modelling for the future would have to take on board what is the future direction of the (EU) Commission under the new leadership, it would have to consider what actions the UK Government would take in response.” ",Sajid Javid refuses to assess economic dangers of Brexit plan,2019-10-21/18:06:35,sajid javid has rebuffed mps demands for the treasury to carry out a thorough economic assessment of the government s brexit deal claiming it is self evidently in our economic interest the chancellor has written to mps on the cross party treasury select committee which requested a fresh analysis in order to help mps judge whether to support the deal javid suggested ending the uncertainty that has surrounded the issue of brexit would in itself be beneficial to the economy and rejected the idea that the government should carry out a new analysis and then make it available to mps my starting point is that agreeing the withdrawal agreement is self evidently in our economic interest he said it would bring an end to the damaging uncertainty and delay of the past years and allow businesses to get on with taking decisions including around recruitment and investment the cross whitehall economic analysis published last year suggested the economy would be considerably weaker under a free trade agreement fta the type of relationship targeted under boris johnson s latest deal but javid said those forecasts only considered a generic average fta looking at examples from around the world he suggested the shape of the uk s fta with the eu would only become clear during the course of the negotiations once brexit had happened john mcdonnell the shadow chancellor said flying blind on a massive decision on the future of the economy is no way for a government to make recommendations to parliament or make legislation it s preposterous behaviour by the chancellor and this government independent analysis by the uk in a changing europe thinktank suggested johnson s plan would knock between   to  off gdp over the next decade compared with remaining in the eu the equivalent estimates for theresa may s deal were   to   but in stark contrast to the cautious stance associated with his predecessor philip hammond who was referred to by colleagues as spreadsheet phil javid played down the importance of economic forecasts for judging the value of the brexit deal trust in democracy and bringing an end to the division that has characterised this debate over the past three years is something that cannot be measured solely through spreadsheets or impact assessments important though they are he wrote respecting the referendum and closing this chapter so we can focus on delivering growth and the public services people deserve is the right thing to do for our country anand menon the director of uk in a changing europe said it is a shame that the chancellor seems to feel that evidence is now superfluous to good policy making self evidently there is more at stake here than just economics that being said surely we deserve to know the different potential implications of different kinds of brexit torsten bell the director of the resolution foundation thinktank said the chancellor is right to say lots of other things will affect what the economic outcome for britain is but what is true is that every major study done inside or outside government shows that a looser relationship with the eu as envisaged in this agreement leads to a smaller economy than it would otherwise be the full text of the withdrawal agreement bill which the government hopes to rush through parliament in order to leave the eu on  october is expected to be published on monday evening javid is due to hold a budget on  november if brexit goes ahead next week and the independent office for budget responsibility will then present updated economic forecasts though it is unclear whether they have enough time to analyse the details of the johnson deal in the commons labour s ian murray said he was unable to answer his constituents who ask about the impact johnson s deal would have on their finances because the government is refusing to publish an economic impact assessment brexit secretary stephen barclay replied the answer is to listen to the bank of england governor who says that getting this deal passed will be a boost to our economy catherine mckinnell labour mp for newcastle upon tyne north said mps were being left in the dark about the economic impact of the new brexit deal responding barclay said the reality is that any modelling for the future would have to take on board what is the future direction of the eu commission under the new leadership it would have to consider what actions the uk government would take in response ,Brexit,0.1783968061208725
140,"Granted, Brexit is driving everyone mad. We Brits owe all our European friends a sincere apology, a bottle of whisky and complimentary tickets to a Royal Shakespeare Company performance of Hamlet. For Britain is now Hamlet, forever agonising over whether Brexit is to be or not to be.So I can perfectly understand why Europeans such as French president Emmanuel Macron just want to be shot of us, so as to push ahead with an important, ambitious agenda for the whole European Union. Nonetheless, it remains in Europe’s own enlightened, long-term interest to go the extra kilometre. This means, concretely, that if the British parliament does not approve Boris Johnson’s new deal this week, the EU should offer an article 50 extension, as formally requested in the letter sent (though childishly not signed) by Johnson.I offer four arguments for this, all made from the point of view of the EU and Europe as a whole. First, a no-deal Brexit would be hugely damaging to Ireland and other parts of Europe geographically close to the UK. The amendment proposed by the independent Conservative Oliver Letwin and passed by parliament on Saturday is intended, above all, to preclude no deal. Letwin himself has said he will vote for Johnson’s deal, if it comes through parliament in the correct legal form and subject to proper scrutiny.Second, there is the question of who takes the blame. We know from a leaked document that the Johnson team of hard Brexiteers were preparing to blame any failure to get a deal on the “crazy” intransigence of Brussels. If, however, Macron were to make an unholy alliance with Johnson to push Britain out of the door on 31 October, then my side of the Brexit argument – the 3R side: for referendum, remain and reform – would be bound to place part of the blame on our European partners. At the moment, the EU has got itself in exactly the right position: it has showed sufficient firmness to defend the interests of Ireland and the single market, and sufficient flexibility to make any accusation of a punitive “Versailles” treaty completely implausible. For example, the EU breached its own red lines in reopening the withdrawal agreement, to make possible the new deal. It’s important that the EU stays in this sweet spot.Third, it would be better for the long-term future of Europe if the UK stayed in the EU. There is no good outcome to Brexit, but the least worst way forward is for Britain to vote in a second referendum to remain. And the best way to achieve that is for parliament to vote for Johnson’s deal but subject to a confirmatory referendum in which the British public would be asked to make a binding, final decision on a single, clear question: do you want Britain to leave the EU on the terms negotiated by this government, or do you want it to stay in the EU? To be or not to be.Since this government is dominated by hard Brexiteers – and what is envisaged in the new deal is a hard Brexit for England, Wales and Scotland, with a softer one only for Northern Ireland – no leave voter could plausibly complain they were only being offered the choice between a flaccid Brino (Brexit in Name Only) and staying in the EU. Hundreds of thousands rallied outside parliament on Saturday to show their support for such a people’s vote. Even more important than the activists are the opinion polls that now persistently show a majority for remain. How absurd it would be if the UK was to leave the EU, in the name of respecting “the will of the people”, at precisely the moment when the will of the people had changed.I know that many continental European friends who were once sympathetic to a second referendum now think the EU would be better off without us. But if Britain leaves now, it will take another five years to work out what the new economic relationship with the EU will be and whether Scotland will leave the United Kingdom, and then a further five years to see how all this beds down in practice. By that time, the EU and what is left of the UK will certainly have diverged. Britain will be worse off economically than it might have been, but probably not so badly off that stubborn English voters, in particular, would swiftly choose to return. If Brexit goes badly for the UK, that will ensure a thoroughly unhappy and bad-tempered relationship across the Channel, negatively affecting the vital cooperation on foreign and security policy.If, against the odds, Brexit goes well for Britannia, then nationalist populists like Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, the Italian Matteo Salvini and France’s Marine Le Pen will start to say, in those immortal words from the movie When Harry Met Sally: “I’ll have what she’s having.” Either way, it’s bad for the European Union.And there’s a fourth argument that should clinch the case. At the moment, Europe is the last best hope of a values-based west, standing up for democracy and the rule of law. Confronted with the demolition of liberal democracy in EU member states such as Hungary, this is one of the most important tasks for the next chapter of EU history, with new leadership in all European institutions, a freshly elected European parliament and a seven-year budget to be agreed.Prominent among the European leaders crowding round to congratulate Johnson after the deal was done last week was Orbán – he and Johnson are brothers under the skin. Johnson’s schoolboy manoeuvre of sending an unsigned, photocopied letter requesting an extension (as mandated by the so-called Benn act), together with a signed one encouraging the EU to refuse that request, shows just how contemptuous he is of a law passed by Britain’s sovereign parliament. Although his lawyers probably ensured that his conduct did not violate the letter of the law, it certainly violated the spirit of the law.Fortunately, the checks and balances of British liberal democracy are working. In a magnificent, muscular verdict, the supreme court found that Johnson acted unlawfully in trying to prorogue parliament for five weeks. And on Saturday, a democratically elected parliament once again took back control from a bullying executive, to ensure proper scrutiny of a hastily made deal which has epochal implications for both Britain and Europe. Whether this ends with a confirmatory referendum, as I hope, or with a general election, which seems more likely – or with parliament narrowly approving Johnson’s deal, which I would lament but accept – it will be a lawful, democratic process. And a lawful, democratic process is something Europe should always support, even if it takes a little longer.• Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnist. His latest book is Free Speech: Ten Principles for a Connected World","Europe is fed up with Brexit, but it’s still best for all if Britain stays in",2019-10-20/17:30:39,granted brexit is driving everyone mad we brits owe all our european friends a sincere apology a bottle of whisky and complimentary tickets to a royal shakespeare company performance of hamlet for britain is now hamlet forever agonising over whether brexit is to be or not to be so i can perfectly understand why europeans such as french president emmanuel macron just want to be shot of us so as to push ahead with an important ambitious agenda for the whole european union nonetheless it remains in europe s own enlightened long term interest to go the extra kilometre this means concretely that if the british parliament does not approve boris johnson s new deal this week the eu should offer an article  extension as formally requested in the letter sent though childishly not signed by johnson i offer four arguments for this all made from the point of view of the eu and europe as a whole first a no deal brexit would be hugely damaging to ireland and other parts of europe geographically close to the uk the amendment proposed by the independent conservative oliver letwin and passed by parliament on saturday is intended above all to preclude no deal letwin himself has said he will vote for johnson s deal if it comes through parliament in the correct legal form and subject to proper scrutiny second there is the question of who takes the blame we know from a leaked document that the johnson team of hard brexiteers were preparing to blame any failure to get a deal on the crazy intransigence of brussels if however macron were to make an unholy alliance with johnson to push britain out of the door on  october then my side of the brexit argument the r side for referendum remain and reform would be bound to place part of the blame on our european partners at the moment the eu has got itself in exactly the right position it has showed sufficient firmness to defend the interests of ireland and the single market and sufficient flexibility to make any accusation of a punitive versailles treaty completely implausible for example the eu breached its own red lines in reopening the withdrawal agreement to make possible the new deal it s important that the eu stays in this sweet spot third it would be better for the long term future of europe if the uk stayed in the eu there is no good outcome to brexit but the least worst way forward is for britain to vote in a second referendum to remain and the best way to achieve that is for parliament to vote for johnson s deal but subject to a confirmatory referendum in which the british public would be asked to make a binding final decision on a single clear question do you want britain to leave the eu on the terms negotiated by this government or do you want it to stay in the eu to be or not to be since this government is dominated by hard brexiteers and what is envisaged in the new deal is a hard brexit for england wales and scotland with a softer one only for northern ireland no leave voter could plausibly complain they were only being offered the choice between a flaccid brino brexit in name only and staying in the eu hundreds of thousands rallied outside parliament on saturday to show their support for such a people s vote even more important than the activists are the opinion polls that now persistently show a majority for remain how absurd it would be if the uk was to leave the eu in the name of respecting the will of the people at precisely the moment when the will of the people had changed i know that many continental european friends who were once sympathetic to a second referendum now think the eu would be better off without us but if britain leaves now it will take another five years to work out what the new economic relationship with the eu will be and whether scotland will leave the united kingdom and then a further five years to see how all this beds down in practice by that time the eu and what is left of the uk will certainly have diverged britain will be worse off economically than it might have been but probably not so badly off that stubborn english voters in particular would swiftly choose to return if brexit goes badly for the uk that will ensure a thoroughly unhappy and bad tempered relationship across the channel negatively affecting the vital cooperation on foreign and security policy if against the odds brexit goes well for britannia then nationalist populists like hungarian

234,"There is a real risk that the coming general election could be the United Kingdom’s last – with Boris Johnson remembered only for being its last Conservative prime minister. Johnson’s deal is, we now know, even more fatally flawed than Theresa May’s in vital respects: it threatens to make Ireland a smugglers’ and tax avoiders’ paradise and ushers in a race to the bottom in social and environmental standards. All Labour MPs must vote against it. The deal also threatens to Balkanise Britain. Northern Ireland is, for example, exempted from the evil consequences of a US-UK trade deal – from the entry of chlorinated chicken to the contracting out of NHS services – while Scotland, Wales and England would be bound in.By the way he has chosen to resolve one source of division, the Northern Ireland border, Johnson appears hellbent on creating another that nationalists are already seeking to exploit. He is jeopardising, perhaps to the point of its destruction, Scotland’s 300-year-old union with England and thus the very existence of the UK.The extremes now before us – the Johnson deal and an equally hardline 'revoke' – will only exacerbate bitter divisionsSo the looming exit is shaping up not as the Dunkirk moment imagined by Brexiteers, with the whole country coming together as one, rolling up its sleeves and glorying in isolation as, united, it faces the foe. Instead it looks like D-day in reverse: a divided, broken-down country retreating from the Europe it once helped to save; and instead of taking control of its future, losing control to the point that it may no longer be able to hold itself together. So when parliament meets on Saturday, the central issue is no longer just what kind of Brexit we have, but what kind of Britain we want to become – and whether there is to be a Britain at all. And the question each party has to ask is: what will it take to heal the wounds of a country now so rent asunder that it qualifies as having many of the features of a failed state?If the debate on Saturday, and in the coming election campaign, fixates on the two extremes now before us – the Johnson deal and an equally hardline “revoke” – we will only exacerbate our bitter divisions. Just as the Conservatives now discount the views of the 16.1 million who voted remain, so too the Liberal Democrats’ plan to nullify the 2016 referendum without a further peoples’ vote dismisses the concerns of the 17.4 million who voted leave. So it falls to Labour – a remain party that has always acknowledged the real anxieties of leave voters – to set out a path to reunite Britain. The current position of negotiating a better leave package and following it with a second referendum should be updated in the light of Johnson’s existential challenge to the UK. Labour must now propose – and recommend – a renegotiated remain option as well before giving the British people the final say.There were, of course, many concerns raised in 2016 by Brexit voters: the state of our manufacturing and our industrial towns and a general feeling that our politicians had let us down and lost the plot in the post-imperial era. But the central demands of Brexiteers – directly relevant to our EU membership – were to take back control of our borders and our laws. These demands can now be seen in a new light. In their 2016 negotiations the Conservatives failed – whether out of ignorance, idleness or simply sheer stupidity – to examine in detail the national freedoms already exercised by the Germans, French, Italians and others within EU law. We were, and still are, free to make new choices.First, it is possible to regain more control of our borders. We could do as Germany does: register migrant workers as they arrive; or, as Belgium does, impose a time limit on any stay without work. In high-unemployment areas, new jobs could first be advertised at local job centres, as in Switzerland. And to stop unfair labour-market competition, whereby the good employer is undercut by the bad, and the bad by the worst, we could end, as France has done since 2016, the practice of “social dumping” and embrace the new German proposal for a European-wide minimum wage. All these objectives are implementable within the general EU principles of freedom of movement alongside enhanced social and environmental rights.Second, we can ease worries that we have lost control of our laws. We can take more control of our laws in a manner consistent with EU law through domestic legal reform which guarantees the supremacy of the UK constitution. To establish immediate constitutional protections, parliament can issue a “sovereignty declaration” which affirms the UK’s commitment to preserving its constitutional identity in its application of EU law. It could then pass a “sovereignty statute” to guarantee the supremacy of the UK constitution. All this is totally consistent with article 4 (2) of the treaty of Lisbon which requires the EU to respect “national identities”.So there is a reformed remain offer readily available that I am confident Europe will accept, and which puts not just a botched Brexit – with all its angst, idiocy, and grave economic risks – behind us, but also rejects revoke as a pseudo-solution. Instead we can move ahead confidently, renegotiating – not from weakness, but from strength – a bold new plan to make Europe work for Britain.For, as this week’s events have demonstrated, it is the ultimate destiny of Britain that will be on the ballot paper when next we vote: whether under a government that looks more and more like the rump of a once national party, we are to be an inward-looking, anti-immigrant, intolerant country, intoxicated by isolation and fragmented by four nationalisms; or whether we are to emerge as a Britain that is outward-looking, tolerant, inclusive and pragmatic, renewing our character as a multinational state, and once again an engaged and visionary leader on the European and the world stage.• Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to

316,"Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, has claimed “the votes are now there” for Boris Johnson to pass a Brexit deal through parliament.Rees-Mogg, a close ally of Johnson, who is responsible for legislation in the Commons, made the bold claim on the radio station LBC, despite the fact the prime minister is yet to secure a deal with Brussels.To win a vote, the prime minister would need the support of almost all Eurosceptics in the Conservative party, as well as most of the former Tories from whom he withdrew the whip and either the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) or a bloc of Labour MPs.Johnson is edging closer to the number he needs, with more prominent Eurosceptics now on board with his plans. Steve Baker, the leader of the European Research Group (ERG), sounded positive after a meeting in No 10: “The mood of the Eurosceptics meeting here tonight was that we do, we can and we must trust the PM.”However, the DUP, which has reservations over plans to leave Northern Ireland in close alignment with the EU, has still not publicly declared its backing and was reserving judgment on Tuesday night.Pro-deal Labour MPs would need reassurances about workers’ rights, environmental protections and the future relationship – and will come under pressure from their party not to vote with the government.Despite the fact that Theresa May’s deal was rejected three times by the Commons, Rees-Mogg said: “If a deal is agreed with the European Union, it will get through, in my view, the House of Commons because everybody’s desperate to finish this.”Shedding more light on the process, he said: “We’ve been doing this for three and a half years; it can’t go on forever. We are near a conclusion and parliament, once it’s agreed something, can legislate very quickly. So, if the meaningful vote goes through, then the legislation will merely be the ratification in domestic law of the treaty and that, I think, is a relatively easy bill to pass, if there is a deal.”He claimed some “big changes” have happened since May failed to get her deal with the EU through parliament, including a shift in the mood towards getting Brexit done and Brussels agreeing to reopen the withdrawal agreement.However, the former cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who resigned over Johnson’s lack of progress towards a deal, said she thought there was a “whiff of sexism” about Eurosceptics in the European Research Group being prepared to vote for the prime minister’s potential deal after rejecting May’s agreement.She told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Emma Barnet: “It is difficult to fillet it out, how much is about a more trusting relationship that they clearly have with Boris Johnson, because he himself was very much part of that ERG group in terms of wanting a harder Brexit than the former prime minister wanted, but I do feel as a woman who’s active in politics myself, that there is a whiff of sexism, as you put it, as well.”When asked why Conservative MPs could vote for a potential Johnson deal when they rejected May’s deal, Rudd said: “There are certain behaviours that particularly men in politics want to see, that women don’t so much, that Boris did adopt, which has given the ERG members a lot of confidence.“So, for instance, I was very opposed to the prime minister expelling 21 colleagues from the party as MPs, and I felt very strongly that Ken Clarke, who had been in Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet, should have a place in Boris Johnson’s party.“But he took a different view, and I thought that was a very aggressive thing to do, and unnecessary, and has had the effect of radicalising the 21 – which I have now joined. So that sort of aggressive behaviour, though, may be the sort of thing that a group of ERG men, particularly, wanted to see.”","'The votes are now there' for Brexit deal, says Jacob Rees-Mogg",2019-10-15/20:08:44,jacob rees mogg the leader of the house of commons has claimed the votes are now there for boris johnson to pass a brexit deal through parliament rees mogg a close ally of johnson who is responsible for legislation in the commons made the bold claim on the radio station lbc despite the fact the prime minister is yet to secure a deal with brussels to win a vote the prime minister would need the support of almost all eurosceptics in the conservative party as well as most of the former tories from whom he withdrew the whip and either the democratic unionist party dup or a bloc of labour mps johnson is edging closer to the number he needs with more prominent eurosceptics now on board with his plans steve baker the leader of the european research group erg sounded positive after a meeting in no  the mood of the eurosceptics meeting here tonight was that we do we can and we must trust the pm however the dup which has reservations over plans to leave northern ireland in close alignment with the eu has still not publicly declared its backing and was reserving judgment on tuesday night pro deal labour mps would need reassurances about workers rights environmental protections and the future relationship and will come under pressure from their party not to vote with the government despite the fact that theresa may s deal was rejected three times by the commons rees mogg said if a deal is agreed with the european union it will get through in my view the house of commons because everybody s desperate to finish this shedding more light on the process he said we ve been doing this for three and a half years it can t go on forever we are near a conclusion and parliament once it s agreed something can legislate very quickly so if the meaningful vote goes through then the legislation will merely be the ratification in domestic law of the treaty and that i think is a relatively easy bill to pass if there is a deal he claimed some big changes have happened since may failed to get her deal with the eu through parliament including a shift in the mood towards getting brexit done and brussels agreeing to reopen the withdrawal agreement however the former cabinet minister amber rudd who resigned over johnson s lack of progress towards a deal said she thought there was a whiff of sexism about eurosceptics in the european research group being prepared to vote for the prime minister s potential deal after rejecting may s agreement she told bbc radio  live s emma barnet it is difficult to fillet it out how much is about a more trusting relationship that they clearly have with boris johnson because he himself was very much part of that erg group in terms of wanting a harder brexit than the former prime minister wanted but i do feel as a woman who s active in politics myself that there is a whiff of sexism as you put it as well when asked why conservative mps could vote for a potential johnson deal when they rejected may s deal rudd said there are certain behaviours that particularly men in politics want to see that women don t so much that boris did adopt which has given the erg members a lot of confidence so for instance i was very opposed to the prime minister expelling  colleagues from the party as mps and i felt very strongly that ken clarke who had been in margaret thatcher s cabinet should have a place in boris johnson s party but he took a different view and i thought that was a very aggressive thing to do and unnecessary and has had the effect of radicalising the  which i have now joined so that sort of aggressive behaviour though may be the sort of thing that a group of erg men particularly wanted to see ,Brexit,0.254867285490036
377,"Michel Barnier has given Boris Johnson “one last chance” to settle on a plan for the Irish border that will prevent a hard border, protect the all-Ireland economy and avoid the creation of a backdoor into the single market for smugglers and fraudsters. EU leaders will gather in Brussels on Thursday to sign off on such a plan, or start talking about a Brexit extension.Johnson conceded to the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, last week that a deal involving the redrawing of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic was not on the cards as it would lead to checks, controls and infrastructure on the island of Ireland.The latest plan from Downing Street, albeit one first revealed by the Guardian as being in the government’s top draw in March 2018, is for a customs border in the Irish Sea – but only for goods travelling from Great Britain via Northern Ireland and on to the rest of the EU, including the Republic of Ireland.Northern Ireland would be part of the UK’s customs territory, but there would be a channel system at the region’s two main ports and airport: a green channel for goods from Great Britain destined only for sale in Northern Ireland and avoiding the need for checks or constraint on their movement; and a red channel for goods destined for beyond the region that would undergo checks and controls.There would be “draconian penalties for noncompliance” and goods would be tracked. There would be extra spot checks in the market to provide assurance that goods sold in the Republic Ireland met all the necessary requirements. Customs paperwork would be done ahead of time to allow those selling products in Northern Ireland to reclaim any differential in tariffs between the UK and the EU.The European commission regards the dual customs plan as untested and a threat to the single market owing to the danger of fraud and smuggling. Barnier has raised the example of sugar entering Northern Ireland on a lower tariff but then being sold on as part of a fizzy drink in the Republic. He also argues that the technology could not possibly be in place by the end of the transition period at the end of 2020.Barnier has suggested that any solution involving checks in the Irish Sea should be more based on the Irish backstop first proposed by the EU in February 2018: Northern Ireland stays in the EU’s customs territory and single market in goods. But he does appear to be open to some tweaking this to win over the UK parliament.Northern Ireland could in legal theory be outside the EU’s customs territory as long as the full customs code was enforced at the border: there would be no exemptions, derogations or channels. But a British rebate system could ensure that those selling only into Northern Ireland were not financially hit by tariffs. A hard sell to the Democratic Unionist party. But, as Barnier likes to say, the clock is ticking.",'One last chance': why Irish border question remains sticking point,2019-10-14/18:54:42,michel barnier has given boris johnson one last chance to settle on a plan for the irish border that will prevent a hard border protect the all ireland economy and avoid the creation of a backdoor into the single market for smugglers and fraudsters eu leaders will gather in brussels on thursday to sign off on such a plan or start talking about a brexit extension johnson conceded to the taoiseach leo varadkar last week that a deal involving the redrawing of a customs border between northern ireland and the republic was not on the cards as it would lead to checks controls and infrastructure on the island of ireland the latest plan from downing street albeit one first revealed by the guardian as being in the government s top draw in march  is for a customs border in the irish sea but only for goods travelling from great britain via northern ireland and on to the rest of the eu including the republic of ireland northern ireland would be part of the uk s customs territory but there would be a channel system at the region s two main ports and airport a green channel for goods from great britain destined only for sale in northern ireland and avoiding the need for checks or constraint on their movement and a red channel for goods destined for beyond the region that would undergo checks and controls there would be draconian penalties for noncompliance and goods would be tracked there would be extra spot checks in the market to provide assurance that goods sold in the republic ireland met all the necessary requirements customs paperwork would be done ahead of time to allow those selling products in northern ireland to reclaim any differential in tariffs between the uk and the eu the european commission regards the dual customs plan as untested and a threat to the single market owing to the danger of fraud and smuggling barnier has raised the example of sugar entering northern ireland on a lower tariff but then being sold on as part of a fizzy drink in the republic he also argues that the technology could not possibly be in place by the end of the transition period at the end of  barnier has suggested that any solution involving checks in the irish sea should be more based on the irish backstop first proposed by the eu in february  northern ireland stays in the eu s customs territory and single market in goods but he does appear to be open to some tweaking this to win over the uk parliament northern ireland could in legal theory be outside the eu s customs territory as long as the full customs code was enforced at the border there would be no exemptions derogations or channels but a british rebate system could ensure that those selling only into northern ireland were not financially hit by tariffs a hard sell to the democratic unionist party but as barnier likes to say the clock is ticking ,Brexit,0.26479074358940125
398,"Hopes of a Brexit breakthrough surged after Leo Varadkar and Boris Johnson went for a walk in the Wirral and declared “a pathway to a possible deal”. Four days later it is increasingly obvious that the pathway is steep and strewn with rocks.After a weekend of Brexit talks, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, gave EU diplomats a bleak account of progress on Sunday night. At the heart of the problem is the same old Brexit conundrum: how can the UK quit the EU customs union and single market while maintaining an open border with Ireland to protect peace on the island.Last Thursday at Thornton Manor, Johnson made a major concession: he agreed there should be no customs border on the island of Ireland. That was the key to triggering the current round of intensified talks in Brussels. But dashing EU hopes, it is clear the UK is not seeking to return to a lightly retouched version of Barnier’s original plan, the Northern Ireland-only backstop. Instead, the UK hopes to devise an unprecedented bespoke customs deal for Northern Ireland.While the British have not disclosed the plan, EU sources have outlined the main details. Northern Ireland would be legally part of the UK customs area, but practically in the EU customs union, following European rules on tariffs and quotas. It would be simultaneously in and out – a model quickly called Schrödinger’s customs union, in mock homage to the physicist’s theoretical cat that was simultaneously dead and alive.Partly based on a cast-off Theresa May plan, it would allow Johnson to claim the whole of the UK has left the EU. Yet just as May discovered with her customs partnership, problems are plentiful. Brussels is worried about fraud and undermining EU customs rules. Business fears a bureaucratic nightmare. If a Northern Irish fizzy drinks company buys sugar from a non-EU country, what is the legal status of the sugar in the sugar-laden drinks destined for EU consumers? In talks on Monday and Tuesday, the EU are demanding answers to this sickly sweet problem.Barnier was unsparing about the risks for the EU, warning it could unravel the European customs code and poses a serious risk of fraud that could tarnish the single market. While the single market sounds abstract, at heart are concerns about consumer health and safety, and the reputation of European goods and produce. EU officials remember the BSE crisis as a vivid example of how a food scandal can destroy lives and farmers’ reputations.With the customs problem unresolved, the two sides have made little progress on the other stumbling block, how to ensure greater democratic buy-in for Northern Ireland. In another significant concession, Johnson has dropped his insistence that the DUP should be able to veto the creation of an all-Ireland regulatory zone for goods – a key part of the jigsaw in avoiding a hard border. But the two sides have not agreed an alternative consent mechanism, with EU diplomats adamant there can be no unilateral right of exit.Johnson is rapidly discovering the Brexit constraints that May eventually knew so well: EU red lines, strong opposition in the House of Commons – and time.The EU will not take a risky gamble on an untested customs partnership to get a deal over the line on 31 October. If the prime minister wants to stick to his “do or die” pledge, his best hope is a rebranded, retouched version of the EU’s original Northern Ireland only backstop – rejected by May, as something no British prime minister could ever accept.Returning to the original backstop risks failing in the House of Commons. But so does Johnson’s preferred “double customs” plan.

442,"Jeremy Corbyn has poured cold water on the idea that Labour could support an attempt to attach a referendum to Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal at next Saturday’s emergency sitting of parliament.The prime minister is expected to convene the House of Commons for a rare Saturday session, either to ask for support for his deal, if he succeeds in striking one at this week’s European council – or to request that MPs back a no-deal exit at the end of this month.Pro-remain MPs hope to amend any motion put by the government, to insist that Johnson’s deal be subject to a public vote.But asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News whether some MPs would be more likely to support a deal if it would be put to a referendum, Corbyn said, “I think many in parliament, not necessarily Labour MPs but others, might be inclined to support it, because they don’t really agree with the deal – but I would caution them on this.”He said he would instead be keen to see a Labour-style Brexit deal, including a customs union, and guarantees on workers’ rights and environmental standards, put to the public.Corbyn’s comments appeared to put him at odds with the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who said in a speech in Glasgow on Saturday that Labour would press for any deal Johnson secures to be subject to a referendum.“Next week our priorities are clear: if Boris Johnson does manage to negotiate a deal, then we will insist that it is put back to the people in a confirmatory vote,” Starmer said.The Labour leadership has been torn for many months between what it sees as the need to reach out to leave voters in Labour constituencies and the party’s membership, which is strongly remain.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has been accused by some on the left of the party in recent days of making too many concessions to the People’s Vote campaign.The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is a close ally of McDonnell’s and widely regarded as a potential future leadership contender, struck a different tone to Corbyn on Sunday.She said Labour’s policy was that any deal should be put to the public, whether negotiated by a future Labour government, or by Johnson. “I think it should be the position if we’re faced with a deal that’s passed through the Commons by an unelected Tory prime minister that could potentially be damaging to our economy,” said Long-Bailey.On Sky, Corbyn also declined to offer support to those Labour MPs who wanted a referendum held before any general election.Asked which should come first, he carefully laid out Labour’s position, as agreed at the party’s conference in Brighton last month.“We have to get a deal that we can agree on if possible, and the Labour position is that we would take this to a public vote, with a Labour government. Within three months we would hope to reach agreement with the EU. We believe that to be possible, along the lines we’ve set out – and within six months, hold a referendum,” Corbyn said.“And a Labour government would then implement the results of that referendum: between a sensible relationship with Europe, and remain.”Asked when an election should be, Corbyn said: “We’ll look at any deal that comes up, before we trigger an election.” He said he was keen to focus on other issues, including investment, tackling the climate crisis and education.He also brushed aside the question of whether he would step down if Labour lost another general election, as  McDonnell suggested he would in an interview with GQ magazine on Friday.“We’re not expecting to lose the next election: it’s a hypothetical question, and it’s up to the members of our party to decide who the leader is,” Corbyn said. Asked to identify potential candidates, he said: “I am not into the business of ordaining people.”Asked what Labour will do if Johnson failed to pass a deal and refused to implement the Benn act by not requesting a delay to Brexit, Corbyn said his party would “take parliamentary action against him at that point” either through legislation or a no-confidence vote.Corbyn also underlined the Labour stance that he should lead any temporary government were Johnson to lose a confidence vote.“Of course: I’m the leader of the opposition,” said Corbyn. “All the British parliamentary precedents, going back as far as you care to look, are that the first option is that the leader of the opposition be invited to form an administration.”As the Scottish National party gather for its annual conference in Aberdeen, Corbyn denied Labour would consider a formal coalition with the SNP after a general election. “We’re not going into coalition with anybody,” he said.Asked about the possibility of Labour supporting a fresh Scottish independence vote, he said: “We would certainly not countenance it in the early days, or early years, of a Labour government, because I think the 2014 referendum was supposed to be a once in a lifetime opportunity.”",Corbyn cautions against public vote on Johnson's Brexit deal,2019-10-13/10:18:09,jeremy corbyn has poured cold water on the idea that labour could

550,"When Boris Johnson was foreign secretary he allegedly asked his staff about Leo Varadkar: “Why isn’t he called Murphy like all the rest of them?”It was presumably a joke – and not greatly appreciated when the leaked remark reached Dublin. But Johnson had hit on a basic truth about Varadkar. He is not a typical Irish politician.The gay son of an Indian immigrant, a trained medical doctor, and socially awkward, the taoiseach does not fit the usual mould.Instead of gladhanding constituents and attending funerals, two traditional elements of Ireland’s parish pump politics, Varadkar prefers to read policy papers and strategise with aides. He is, in other words, that person mocked by Johnson: a swot.Yet when the two met in north-west England on Thursday, in private, away from journalists and the usual panoply of summitry, Johnson was forced to look up to Varadkar, both literally and metaphorically.The taoiseach is 1.93m ( 6ft 4in) and stands on the shoulders of the European Union – its commission, council, parliament and all 27 member states.The Irish government’s success in mobilising the EU behind the border backstop has rebalanced Ireland’s historically subservient relationship with Britain.Yet Varadkar, like Johnson, is under immense pressure. If the UK leaves the EU with no deal it will hammer Ireland’s economy and destabilise Northern Ireland. But accepting a tweaked version of Downing Street’s current plan, or some other plan that weakens the backstop, could torpedo Varadkar’s hopes of winning Ireland’s looming election.The taoiseach would have got straight down to business.“He doesn’t have a lot of time for, or interest in, small talk,” said Brendan O’Shea, a doctor who trained Varadkar as a medical student. “We have someone who is forensic about what he thinks should be done. The calculating machine will make a decision about what is the best decision then the politician will switch on and figure out a way to sell that.”Growing up as a GP’s son in a middle-class Dublin suburb, young Leo declared, at the age of eight, an ambition to become health minister.A biography says that, as a teenager on a school trip to Northern Ireland, the future taoiseach smuggled fireworks back into the republic, which some might consider a metaphor for his role in Brexit.Varadkar studied medicine at Trinity College Dublin and joined Fine Gael, a centre-right party. Outspoken about tax cuts and welfare reform, some called him “Tory boy”. His heroes included Otto von Bismarck and Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary.As a Teachta Dála (member of the Irish parliament) and minister, Varadkar earned a reputation for energy, direct language and social stiffness – some public interactions left aides cringing.Johnson’s bonhomie, however, may not be totally wasted on Varadkar, who has loosened up since coming out as gay in 2015.“It’s not something that defines me,” the then health minister told RTÉ. “I’m not a half-Indian politician, or a doctor politician or a gay politician for that matter. It’s just part of who I am.”It was a brave admission – Ireland had yet to legalise same-sex marriage. The response was overwhelmingly positive and Varadkar went on to succeed Enda Kenny as leader of Fine Gael and taoiseach in 2017, and in the process to go from Mars bar binger to fitness fanatic.“Coming out changes everybody,” said Tiernan Brady, an LGBT activist who advised Varadkar. “In accepting who you are to yourself, and that you can still go on to lead your party and your country, that’s been really affirming. That brings you a whole level of confidence.”Some Irish backstop sceptics warn that Varadkar’s government may be suffering from over-confidence, that bending Brussels to Dublin’s agenda may backfire, and that the broad national consensus behind the strategy may deter the taoiseach from compromising.“Varadkar’s personal political interests have diverted from the national interest,” said Dan O’Brien, the chief economist at the Institute of International and European Affairs. “His political career could be ended by making a concession on the backstop. Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin would come down on him like a tonne of bricks. It’s never a good idea for a leader to be painted into a corner.”",Breaking the mould: Leo Varadkar is no typical Irish politician,2019-10-10/18:55:16,when boris johnson was foreign secretary he allegedly asked his staff about leo varadkar why isn t he called murphy like all the rest of them it was presumably a joke and not greatly appreciated when the leaked remark reached dublin but johnson had hit on a basic truth about varadkar he is not a typical irish politician the gay son of an indian immigrant a trained medical doctor and socially awkward the taoiseach does not fit the usual mould instead of gladhanding constituents and attending funerals two traditional elements of ireland s parish pump politics varadkar prefers to read policy papers and strategise with aides he is in other words that person mocked by johnson a swot yet when the two met in north west england on thursday in private away from journalists and the usual panoply of summitry johnson was forced to look up to varadkar both literally and metaphorically the taoiseach is  m ft in and stands on the shoulders of the european union its commission council parliament and all  member states the irish government s success in mobilising the eu behind the border backstop has rebalanced ireland s historically subservient relationship with britain yet varadkar like johnson is under immense pressure if the uk leaves the eu with no deal it will hammer ireland s economy and destabilise northern ireland but accepting a tweaked version of downing street s current plan or some other plan that weakens the backstop could torpedo varadkar s hopes of winning ireland s looming election the taoiseach would have got straight down to business he doesn t have a lot of time for or interest in small talk said brendan o shea a doctor who trained varadkar as a medical student we have someone who is forensic about what he thinks should be done the calculating machine will make a decision about what is the best decision then the politician will switch on and figure out a way to sell that growing up as a gp s son in a middle class dublin suburb young leo declared at the age of eight an ambition to become health minister a biography says that as a teenager on a school trip to northern ireland the future taoiseach smuggled fireworks back into the republic which some might consider a metaphor for his role in brexit varadkar studied medicine at trinity college dublin and joined fine gael a centre right party outspoken about tax cuts and welfare reform some called him tory boy his heroes included otto von bismarck and ryanair s michael o leary as a teachta dála member of the irish parliament and minister varadkar earned a reputation for energy direct language and social stiffness some public interactions left aides cringing johnson s bonhomie however may not be totally wasted on varadkar who has loosened up since coming out as gay in  it s not something that defines me the then health minister told rté i m not a half indian politician or a doctor politician or a gay politician for that matter it s just part of who i am it was a brave admission ireland had yet to legalise same sex marriage the response was overwhelmingly positive and varadkar went on to succeed enda kenny as leader of fine gael and taoiseach in  and in the process to go from mars bar binger to fitness fanatic coming out changes everybody said tiernan brady an lgbt activist who advised varadkar in accepting who you are to yourself and that you can still go on to lead your party and your country that s been really affirming that brings you a whole level of confidence some irish backstop sceptics warn that varadkar s government may be suffering from over confidence that bending brussels to dublin s agenda may backfire and that the broad national consensus behind the strategy may deter the taoiseach from compromising varadkar s personal political interests have diverted from the national interest said dan o brien the chief economist at the institute of international and european affairs his political career could be ended by making a concession on the backstop fianna fáil and sinn féin would come down on him like a tonne of bricks it s never a good idea for a leader to be painted into a corner ,Brexit,0.22441251575946808
607,"In light of everything that was known about Boris Johnson before becoming prime minister, his inability to resolve Brexit once installed in Downing Street was to be expected. Only the manner of his failure was unpredictable. Mr Johnson was lazy in his assessment of the EU negotiating position, arrogant in his handling of parliament, and complacent about the strength of opposition there. But perhaps the prime minister’s most damaging error has been to confuse campaign rhetoric with the reality of government.Mr Johnson believed the arguments he used to persuade Tory members to elect him as their leader. He said that Theresa May’s deal was obsolete and that a better deal would be available if the UK listened less to Brussels. That proposition has now been tested and found to be false. Mr Johnson’s alternative Brexit proposals have been rejected. It is not clear whether Downing Street intended its plan to be the starting point for a serious negotiation or just a provocation – designed for rejection ahead of a campaign vilifying foreigners as the obstacles to Brexit liberation.The more cynical view is supported by an anonymous briefing, sourced to No 10, narrating a telephone call in which Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, appeared to demand that Mr Johnson surrender Northern Ireland to Brussels. No one who is familiar with Mrs Merkel’s style of diplomacy imagines that Downing Street accurately reflected what was said. The purpose of such a briefing was to make compromise less likely and stoke international enmity for tactical domestic advantage. It is unclear whether Mr Johnson authorised that message but it hardly matters. He is responsible for his messengers and they are sabotaging the UK’s relationship with vital European allies.A root of the problem is the recruitment to Downing Street of leading figures from the Vote Leave referendum campaign, including its executive strategist Dominic Cummings. That clique is not respectful of Conservative traditions and, in the case of Mr Cummings, despises any sentimental attachment to established modes of governance. That ethos is incompatible with the side of Downing Street that wants to be an orthodox Tory administration, engaging with parliament, maintaining relations with neighbouring states and preserving a semblance of sober statecraft. Those ambitions lead some of the prime minister’s staff and cabinet colleagues to seek a Brexit deal.As a leadership candidate, Mr Johnson did not foresee a clash between the Vote Leave model of relentless campaigning aggression and the day-to-day conduct of grown-up government. He now faces a choice, crystallised in the question of whether to submit to the Benn Act, which requires that the government seek an article 50 extension in the absence of a deal. A responsible prime minister would obey the law (or resign if he felt unable to do so). But Downing Street has let it be known that other notions are under consideration. There are hints at unidentified ruses, suggesting the law might not be so legally binding.Even if the courts compelled compliance, forcing their hand would allow Mr Johnson to portray himself as a Brexit martyr. He might then be in a stronger position to run as the tribune of the people, defying a Europhile establishment in parliament and the judiciary. That is the stuff of authoritarian subversion, and should not appear in the repertoire of democratic politicians.Mr Johnson is not yet at that point, but it is within sight. The prospects of agreement with the EU look remote. The decision to hold an emergency Saturday session of parliament on 19 October, an expedient usually limited to wartime, looks designed to aggravate, not calm, the sense of national emergency. But the prime minister’s choice reveals a more profound conflict at the heart of Downing Street. He has chosen a strategy for fighting an election that requires behaviour unsuitable for running a government. He can be a wrecking candidate, attacking diplomatic, constitutional and democratic norms, or he can be a serious head of government. He can submit to the rule of law or he can pose as a lord of misrule. He cannot do both.",The Guardian view on Johnson’s choice: rule of law or misrule,2019-10-09/18:30:01,in light of everything that was known about boris johnson before becoming prime minister his inability to resolve brexit once installed in downing street was to be expected only the manner of his failure was unpredictable mr johnson was lazy in his assessment of the eu negotiating position arrogant in his handling of parliament and complacent about the strength of opposition there but perhaps the prime minister s most damaging error has been to confuse campaign rhetoric with the reality of government mr johnson believed the arguments he used to persuade tory members to elect him as their leader he said that theresa may s deal was obsolete and that a better deal would be available if the uk listened less to brussels that proposition has now been tested and found to be false mr johnson s alternative brexit proposals have been rejected it is not clear whether downing street intended its plan to be the starting point for a serious negotiation or just a provocation designed for rejection ahead of a campaign vilifying foreigners as the obstacles to brexit liberation the more cynical view is supported by an anonymous briefing sourced to no  narrating a telephone call in which angela merkel the german chancellor appeared to demand that mr johnson surrender northern ireland to brussels no one who is familiar with mrs merkel s style of diplomacy imagines that downing street accurately reflected what was said the purpose of such a briefing was to make compromise less likely and stoke international enmity for tactical domestic advantage it is unclear whether mr johnson authorised that message but it hardly matters he is responsible for his messengers and they are sabotaging the uk s relationship with vital european allies a root of the problem is the recruitment to downing street of leading figures from the vote leave referendum campaign including its executive strategist dominic cummings that clique is not respectful of conservative traditions and in the case of mr cummings despises any sentimental attachment to established modes of governance that ethos is incompatible with the side of downing street that wants to be an orthodox tory administration engaging with parliament maintaining relations with neighbouring states and preserving a semblance of sober statecraft those ambitions lead some of the prime minister s staff and cabinet colleagues to seek a brexit deal as a leadership candidate mr johnson did not foresee a clash between the vote leave model of relentless campaigning aggression and the day to day conduct of grown up government he now faces a choice crystallised in the question of whether to submit to the benn act which requires that the government seek an article  extension in the absence of a deal a responsible prime minister would obey the law or resign if he felt unable to do so but downing street has let it be known that other notions are under consideration there are hints at unidentified ruses suggesting the law might not be so legally binding even if the courts compelled compliance forcing their hand would allow mr johnson to portray himself as a brexit martyr he might then be in a stronger position to run as the tribune of the people defying a europhile establishment in parliament and the judiciary that is the stuff of authoritarian subversion and should not appear in the repertoire of democratic politicians mr johnson is not yet at that point but it is within sight the prospects of agreement with the eu look remote the decision to hold an emergency saturday session of parliament on  october an expedient usually limited to wartime looks designed to aggravate not calm the sense of national emergency but the prime minister s choice reveals a more profound conflict at the heart of downing street he has chosen a strategy for fighting an election that requires behaviour unsuitable for running a government he can be a wrecking candidate attacking diplomatic constitutional and democratic norms or he can be a serious head of government he can submit to the rule of law or he can pose as a lord of misrule he cannot do both ,Brexit,0.1980649083852768
648,"The Irish government has hit back at “misinformation” and “pressure” from Britain as talks over a Brexit deal tottered towards collapse.Simon Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister, said on Tuesday that his administration was working “flat out” for a deal, despite accusations from Downing Street that Dublin had virtually sabotaged any chance of compromise.“No country wants a deal more than Ireland but we will not strike a deal at any cost,” he told a press conference in the Irish capital.Boris Johnson spoke to his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, on Tuesday evening. Downing Street said that “both sides strongly reiterated their desire to reach a Brexit deal” and hoped to meet in person later in the week.However when Coveney was asked earlier about the Downing Street briefings that accused Varadkar of derailing talks with inflexibility over the backstop, he said there had been a “lot of misinformation” and an attempt to pressure Ireland.Without naming Johnson, Dominic Cummings or any other figure in the British government, Coveney said there were “conflicting reports” from London and “a hard line” from those briefing the media.Coveney said that Ireland had welcomed Johnson’s Brexit proposals last week as a “step forward” while stressing that more work was needed to find a solution.“There is an ongoing conversation in Brussels and we want to contribute to that in a constructive way ... the taoiseach wants to find a compromise that works. But he is not willing to be boxed into a corner.”Dublin had been “upfront and honest” in highlighting problems with Downing Street’s plan, said Coveney. “We can’t pretend we’re solving problems when we’re not.”The foreign minister, who doubles as deputy prime minister, said a blame game seemed to be eclipsing a search for solutions: “But this is too enormous an issue to be focusing on the politics of blame.”Coveney was due later to travel to Brussels to meet Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator.EU and Irish officials have criticised Downing Street’s plan as unworkable for taking Northern Ireland out of the EU’s customs union and for giving the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) a veto over trading arrangements.On Tuesday, a No 10 source accused the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, of making a deal impossible. Brussels responded by accusing Johnson of trying to play a “stupid blame game”.Despite Coveney’s insistence that a last-minute deal was still possible, there was a growing sense of dread in Dublin that no-deal Brexit was edging closer, heralding political instability in Northern Ireland and economic pain on both sides of the Irish border.Ireland’s finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, warned of turbulence while presenting the annual budget to the Dáil on Tuesday. “This is a budget that has been developed in the shadow of Brexit,” he said.The country has enjoyed strong growth and tax receipts, but Donohoe said the increasing likelihood of the UK exiting the EU without a deal posed a “pressing and immediate risk” to Ireland’s economy.The government deferred tax cuts and allocated €1.2bn, excluding EU funding, to cushion any shock. Donohoe earmarked €650m to support the agriculture, enterprise and tourism sectors, as well as regions that would be most affected by a no-deal Brexit.At sombre press conferences following the budget announcement, successive ministers detailed their departments’ no-deal Brexit contingency plans. One minister referred to the preparations as “triage”.The teetering Brexit talks have caused the gulf between political parties in Northern Ireland to widen.Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, claimed that an Irish plot had been exposed. “The prime minister’s proposals have flushed out Dublin’s real intentions to trap Northern Ireland in the EU customs union forever, where Dublin rather than the United Kingdom’s elected representatives would be in the driving seat.”Sinn Féin’s deputy leader, Michelle O’Neill, accused the DUP and “other delusional Brexit cheerleaders” of exposing Northern Ireland to potentially catastrophic consequences.“The north’s economy cannot withstand being excluded from the customs union and the single market, and that is the message we will be bringing loud and clear to

750,"One of the disconcerting things about Brexit is its capacity constantly to rewrite the script of political dysfunction. The latest government proposals won’t work. They do represent a significant concession, but create an incoherent muddle leading to a bizarre outcome.Northern Ireland would remain part of Europe’s single market but Britain would leave it. There would be regulatory checks down the Irish Sea but not at the Irish border. There would however be customs checks, so the border would not be open as now. And Northern Ireland’s membership of the single market could be unilaterally revoked by its assembly, which is not presently able to constitute itself, and so the whole plan is subject to the notorious vagaries of Northern Irish politics.Europe will demand a dropping of the DUP veto and something near to the backstop on the customs union. But even if the Johnson government finally concedes everything, the result would be a horrible deal for the UK. And, as presently formed, the proposal undermines the Good Friday agreement in fundamental respects.The open border between north and south was key. Had that been in doubt, there would never have been a peace agreementIt is almost 100 years since the Republic of Ireland insisted on its independence, after the failure of various home rule initiatives to save the union. The six largely unionist and Protestant counties of the north remained with the UK. The south became the Irish nation. It was always an uneasy peace, because a big part of the northern population was Catholic and nationalist, whereas the southern Protestants, like my mother’s family in Donegal, were relatively few in number.Crucial to maintenance of the peace was the idea of an open border between north and south in recognition of the fact that around the border families intermingled, did business and trade and moved, often several times a day, across it. They were separate countries but treated for the practical purposes of daily life as if they were the same.After the second world war, the Republic of Ireland and the UK were in lockstep. We were both out of the EU until, on the same day in 1973, we both joined.At the time, Britain was more enthusiastic about Europe than Ireland. But Ireland understood that because of the strength of the ties between north and south, and the necessity of keeping the border open, if the UK joined, Ireland had to follow suit.However, nationalist and republican sentiment had been rising in Northern Ireland, culminating in the outbreak of violence at the end of the 1960s and in the bitter conflict that over the ensuing three decades cost thousands of lives and untold suffering.When the Good Friday agreement was negotiated in April 1998, the most painstaking and difficult negotiation I was ever involved in, Europe played a role in two ways.Ireland and the UK had started to put the old enmities behind us, as we co-operated in Europe, often finding common cause on issues, and European trade had become a vital part of the island of Ireland’s economy.The shared future in Europe meant that the border diminished in significance. In addition, at the core of the agreement was the following deal: Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK for as long as a majority in the north wanted it, but in return the nationalist aspirations and identity of those who wanted a united Ireland would be recognised and given effect.The open border between north and south was key. Had that been in doubt, there would never have been a peace agreement. Simple as that.All this is to show that the issue of the Irish border is not some invented ruse by “Remoaners” to derail “the will of the people” – it has deep historical roots and was always bound to be critical to the Brexit debate.Now, for the first time, the border between north and south will be the external border of the EU. And if, as Brexiters demand, the UK leaves not just the political structures of Europe but its trading structures – the single market and customs union – then it follows that there will be border checks and the principle of an open border breached. However, right at the outset, when Boris Johnson was foreign secretary, the May government insisted the open border would remain untouched. There was therefore a self-evident inconsistency between that commitment and the commitment to leave the single market and customs union. It could have been resolved by treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. But the government also gave a commitment to the DUP that Northern Ireland would be treated the same.Hence May’s Chequers proposals, which provoked Johnson’s resignation. Her solution was to align the inconsistent commitments essentially by agreeing that the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the single market and with the backstop to fix the customs union problem.Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland. Interactive: A typical hour in the life of the Irish borderJohnson’s solution is effectively to breach the commitment to the unionists, but compensate with a unionist veto, treat Northern Ireland and the UK differently for the single market, but the same for the customs union. He has exactly the dilemma of Theresa May. Either Northern Ireland is treated differently for trade in its entirety or the whole of the UK remains in Europe’s trading system.The present hotchpotch achieves neither outcome, and would undermine the peace so carefully constructed and kept despite all the challenges for more than two decades, with any border-related infrastructure a potential target for violent elements and with a weakening of the “one island” culture at the heart of nationalist aspirations.And this is a bad deal for Britain. The hard Brexit future relationship Johnson promises for Britain will be a hideously painful negotiation that will mean years more of Brexit distraction and made tougher every time a minister proclaims how we intend to compete with Europe on tax and regulation. Even more so with no deal.The biggest tragicomic aspect of the whole sorry saga is the erroneous belief that “getting Brexit done” in this way allows us to “move on”.There is only one way to bring Brexit resolution: to ask the people, given three years of accumulated experience and knowledge and with a specific government position before them, whether they want to tell us again or think again. I live in hope that, having tried everything else, our political leadership will finally realise this.",The EU was crucial to securing peace in Ireland.

823,"Boris Johnson has reached for the word compromise many times in the last two days as he has promoted his new Brexit proposals. There were three mentions of compromise in his party conference speech in Manchester on Wednesday, a further four in his letter to the European commission, two in the statement he delivered to MPs at Westminster on Thursday and several others in the exchanges that followed.These usages, although tendentious, are not wholly specious. Mr Johnson’s proposals are an attempt to bridge the gap between the EU-UK withdrawal agreement signed by Theresa May last year and the root-and-branch rejection of that agreement by the Conservative party’s most dogmatic pro-Brexit faction. Setting aside the fact that Mr Johnson himself voted for that agreement in March, the prime minister has moved the dial a few notches from his previous determination to get rid of the Northern Ireland backstop in its entirety.However, the new proposals are not a compromise with the European Union, which is the body with which he ought to be seeking a deal. They are a compromise with the Democratic Unionist party. Mr Johnson has courted the DUP more assiduously than even Mrs May did. He has spoken at their conferences, invited them into Downing Street and generally gone the extra mile to find ways of appeasing their demands that Northern Ireland should not be treated differently from the rest of the UK. The compromise Mr Johnson has now made with the DUP allows him to say that there can be some all-Ireland regulations for a limited period – which would mean Britain and Northern Ireland leaving on different terms – while the DUP has secured an effective veto over their further continuation, thus ensuring that Northern Ireland will be fully part of the UK customs territory in the longer term. But they are talking to themselves, not to the wider polities of Ireland, Britain or Europe.Mr Johnson ignores three huge issues. The first is that the DUP does not speak for Northern Ireland, whose people voted to remain in the EU in 2016 and where opinion polls regularly show support for the backstop and for separate treatment for Northern Ireland to preserve the all-Ireland economy. By allowing the DUP to act as if it is the government of Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson ignores the majority that oppose the DUP’s pro-Brexit stance and mounting evidence that the DUP is now losing the hegemony that it used to enjoy. Giving a decisive role to Northern Ireland institutions that are suspended for intractable reasons solves nothing (and triggers the demand from Scotland that their devolved institutions should get a veto too). It suggests Mr Johnson might not be able to make his deal stick, even if the EU agreed to it.The second problem is that Mr Johnson’s plans renege on the principles, and legally rooted treaty guarantees, of north-south cooperation that have been the bedrock of the increasingly precarious Northern Ireland peace process. Preserving the Belfast/Good Friday agreement was at the core of Mrs May’s approach. It is part of the EU (Withdrawal) Act itself that the UK will not create any form of “physical infrastructure” for border arrangements after Brexit. The reason why there is a backstop at all is because the May government took these promises seriously. Like so many English Tories in the past and today, Mr Johnson simply does not share that sense of responsibility. His plans betray Britain’s solemn promise and ignore the consequences for Ireland.The final problem is that the vagueness of Mr Johnson’s plans leaves a hole in the EU single market without proposing a workable solution. Controls of any kind are inconsistent with the principle of frictionless trade, while loose controls threaten rules and protections for consumers. It is typical of Mr Johnson and the hardliners that they have failed to engage with these realities at all.Yet the realities are immutable. Britain has profound legal and political obligations to the people of Ireland. Britain has deep moral obligations too. None of these are upheld in the government’s new proposals or by the untrustworthy way Britain behaves on the Irish and European stage. Mr Johnson calls it compromise. It should be called perfidy.",The Guardian view on the backstop proposals: Britain’s broken promise,2019-10-03/18:15:49,boris johnson has reached for the word compromise many times in the last two days as he has promoted his new brexit proposals there were three mentions of compromise in his party conference speech in manchester on wednesday a further four in his letter to the european commission two in the statement he delivered to mps at westminster on thursday and several others in the exchanges that followed these usages although tendentious are not wholly specious mr johnson s proposals are an attempt to bridge the gap between the eu uk withdrawal agreement signed by theresa may last year and the root and branch rejection of that agreement by the conservative party s most dogmatic pro brexit faction setting aside the fact that mr johnson himself voted for that agreement in march the prime minister has moved the dial a few notches from his previous determination to get rid of the northern ireland backstop in its entirety however the new proposals are not a compromise with the european union which is the body with which he ought to be seeking a deal they are a compromise with the democratic unionist party mr johnson has courted the dup more assiduously than even mrs may did he has spoken at their conferences invited them into downing street and generally gone the extra mile to find ways of appeasing their demands that northern ireland should not be treated differently from the rest of the uk the compromise mr johnson has now made with the dup allows him to say that there can be some all ireland regulations for a limited period which would mean britain and northern ireland leaving on different terms while the dup has secured an effective veto over their further continuation thus ensuring that northern ireland will be fully part of the uk customs territory in the longer term but they are talking to themselves not to the wider polities of ireland britain or europe mr johnson ignores three huge issues the first is that the dup does not speak for northern ireland whose people voted to remain in the eu in  and where opinion polls regularly show support for the backstop and for separate treatment for northern ireland to preserve the all ireland economy by allowing the dup to act as if it is the government of northern ireland mr johnson ignores the majority that oppose the dup s pro brexit stance and mounting evidence that the dup is now losing the hegemony that it used to enjoy giving a decisive role to northern ireland institutions that are suspended for intractable reasons solves nothing and triggers the demand from scotland that their devolved institutions should get a veto too it suggests mr johnson might not be able to make his deal stick even if the eu agreed to it the second problem is that mr johnson s plans renege on the principles and legally rooted treaty guarantees of north south cooperation that have been the bedrock of the increasingly precarious northern ireland peace process preserving the belfast good friday agreement was at the core of mrs may s approach it is part of the eu withdrawal act itself that the uk will not create any form of physical infrastructure for border arrangements after brexit the reason why there is a backstop at all is because the may government took these promises seriously like so many english tories in the past and today mr johnson simply does not share that sense of responsibility his plans betray britain s solemn promise and ignore the consequences for ireland the final problem is that the vagueness of mr johnson s plans leaves a hole in the eu single market without proposing a workable solution controls of any kind are inconsistent with the principle of frictionless trade while loose controls threaten rules and protections for consumers it is typical of mr johnson and the hardliners that they have failed to engage with these realities at all yet the realities are immutable britain has profound legal and political obligations to the people of ireland britain has deep moral obligations too none of these are upheld in the government s new proposals or by the untrustworthy way britain behaves on the irish and european stage mr johnson calls it compromise it should be called perfidy ,Brexit,0.30025026202201843
835,"The European parliament has told Boris Johnson that his proposals for the Irish border do not “even remotely” amount to an acceptable deal for the EU, in comments echoed by Ireland’s prime minister.The committee of MEPs representing the parliament’s views on Brexit said the prime minister’s proposals could not form the basis for an agreement, describing them as a “last-minute” effort. The European parliament will have a veto on any withdrawal agreement.“Safeguarding peace and stability on the island of Ireland, protection of citizens and EU’s legal order has to be the main focus of any deal,” it said in a statement. “The UK proposals do not match even remotely what was agreed as a sufficient compromise in the backstop.”Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, also accused Johnson of contradicting his own proposals during an appearance by the British prime minister in the Commons, in which he sought to convince MPs there would be no return of a hard Irish border.Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border.

Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland. Interactive: A typical hour in the life of the Irish borderSpeaking shortly after Johnson addressed the Commons, Varadkar highlighted a discrepancy between Johnson’s words and the legal text tabled by the UK government.“I am reassured by what Prime Minister Johnson said today: that he is not proposing that there should be any new physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland linked to customs or customs checks,” Varadkar said.“But that is actually in contradiction to the papers presented by the UK government yesterday. So I think working with the EU taskforce in part, [Michel] Barnier’s taskforce, and also talking with the UK government we will have to tease out the detail of what those proposals mean.”In a barbed comment, Varadkar further suggested the British public had changed its mind on Brexit but was being prevented from having its voice heard. “All the polls since Mr Johnson became PM suggest that’s what the British people actually want, but their political system is not able to give them that choice,” he said. Guy Verhofstadt, the former prime minister of Belgium who coordinates the European parliament’s Brexit steering group, said it was “nearly impossible” to see how a deal could be secured on the basis of the proposals.He pointed to a leaked script handed to Conservative MPs by the party, which instructed them to attack the EU as “crazy” if it rejected proposals as an indication of Johnson’s insincerity about wanting a deal.“If there is a Tory document saying that they have to blame the European Union then it’s obvious that that is the purpose,” he said.The prime minister had said in his letter to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, accompanying the legal text of the UK’s proposals for replacing the Irish backstop that his ideas amounted to a “broad landing zone” for a deal.He will now be tested by the EU on how far he will compromise on the key areas of contention, in particular on the imposition of a customs border on the island of Ireland, a seeming red line for the new government.The parliament’s Brexit steering group said the plan for customs checks and controls on the island of Ireland would “breach a range of fundamental principles and red lines”.“The UK proposals on customs and on regulatory aspects explicitly provide for infrastructure, controls and checks but are unclear as to exactly where and how these would be carried out,” the committee said. “Any form of controls and checks in and around the border would signify the end of frictionless trade and as such would harm the all-island economy as well as represent a serious risk to the peace process, and could imply a serious risk for our consumers and businesses.”The MEPs said the parliament would also veto any withdrawal agreement that did not provide a failsafe solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.The UK’s suggestion of working out the details of how technology could be used to help with that during the Brexit transition period was said to be unacceptable.Johnson has proposed that Northern Ireland stay in the EU’s single market for goods on the basis that Stormont agrees in a vote before the end of the transition period, and then every four years.The committee said this provided a unilateral right to exit arrangements that would create huge uncertainty for the Republic of Ireland.The MEPs said: “The right of consent being offered to the Northern Irish assembly effectively makes an agreement contingent, uncertain, provisional, unilateral, instead of the safety net provided for by the backstop.“Furthermore, the Northern Irish assembly has not sat for nearly three years, and it is questionable whether it would be able to reconvene and take on the responsibility for an international treaty of this nature.”The UK’s negotiator, David Frost, is expected back in Brussels on Friday, possibly with the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay. EU sources said that it was crucial for him to indicate that the government was willing to give further ground to get a deal before 31 October when the UK is due to leave the bloc.A European commission spokeswoman said it was up the British government to move its position for progress to be possible, and that Juncker had made that point in a phone call with Johnson.She said: “There are problematic points in the UK’s proposal and further work is needed. This work is for the UK to do, not the other way around.”Speaking after a meeting with Sweden’s prime minister, Varadkar said Ireland’s objective remained to avoid “any customs posts between north and south or any tariffs or restraints on trade between north and south”.“They were all abolished in the 1990s,” Varadkar said. “We don’t want to go back to that. The majority of the people in the north don’t, the majority of the people in the Republic of Ireland don’t. But if we are going to be in two customs unions that is going to be incredibly hard to reconcile.”Speaking to MPs in the Commons earlier in the day, Johnson insisted that the whole of the UK would leave the EU’s customs union on 31 October and that this was a fundamental part of his vision for the country.Asked by the former cabinet minister Damian Green whether this would involve extra infrastructure anywhere on the island of Ireland, Johnson reassured him that it would not. “I can tell him that absolutely not. The proposals we are putting forward do not involve physical infrastructure at or near the border or indeed at any other place.”But an explanatory document tabled with the European commission appears to suggest there would be both a need to police the area to avoid smuggling and that customs checks would be carried out “at traders’ premises or other designated locations which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland”.

839,"Compromises always involve discomfort. In a typical negotiation, both sides can arrive at a compromise on the understanding that, for each of them, the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs. It is the political and economic fragility of Northern Ireland that has made compromise between the UK and the EU, in the withdrawal agreement, necessary in the first place. Yet under Boris Johnson’s proposals for the Irish border, the discomfort caused by the compromise would be borne almost exclusively by this small region. As they currently stand, his plans indicate a British government more willing to compromise Northern Ireland than it is to compromise over Brexit.What Johnson has offered the European commission is unexpected: instead of an invidious choice between a hard border on the Irish Sea or one across the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland shall have both. The rub is that Johnson is handing the responsibility for this decision now to the EU – as if the effects of such borders (either with a deal or no deal) will be primarily Ireland’s problem and not one for the whole UK. His proposal persists with the illusion that Britain can have a cost-free Brexit, now enabled by putting the burden of managing the consequences on to the island of Ireland.This is clear from the two main dimensions of these proposals. First, regulatory alignment. Although Johnson claims that these proposals remove the so-called backstop, the most substantive part of it endures – and with bells on. Northern Ireland would effectively remain part of the EU’s single market for “all goods”. The critical difference between this and the backstop, however, is that it is not conditional. Northern Ireland shall be in a different regulatory zone to Britain regardless of the type of UK-EU relationship that is meant to be devised, miraculously quickly, by the end of the transition period.Second, the greatest and most immediate difficulty comes in the ratcheting up of the status of the Irish border into a customs border. Theresa May promised “no return to the borders of the past” on the island of Ireland. One border of the past that many people here remember vividly was a customs border. They remember the paperwork, the inconvenience, the delays, the targeting of customs officers. What they remember less is how the economy was transformed when the benefits of being part of the EU’s customs union could be married with the benefits of peace. It is all too easy for that to be reversed. The harder the Brexit, the more severe the impact of a customs border will be. What Johnson proposes will not protect Northern Ireland from these effects – it will, in fact, exacerbate them.The problem with the post-Brexit Irish border has always been managing the conundrum of avoiding making it a hard border (which would disrupt the conditions for peace, under the Good Friday agreement) while running it efficiently. Any customs border worth its salt needs to be managed well. You have to assure prospective partners for trade deals that negotiations are worth their while, because you don’t have leaky borders. You also need to assure local traders that their domestic market is protected against both smuggling and shoddy cheap imports, because the border is effective. If the Irish border is not run well – especially if the UK is determined on a hard Brexit – then smuggling not only becomes easier, it becomes more lucrative. The customs procedures outlined in the UK government’s proposals are not extraordinary, but neither are they a convincing means of border management in this unique context. In fact, what Johnson is putting forward as mitigating measures are pretty familiar at this stage, having been broadly outlined as long ago as August 2017, in the UK government’s white papers on customs and on Northern Ireland.They have worked elsewhere when they are used to help facilitate the movement of goods across a hard border. If there is no hard border, and no effective means of catching illegitimate operations, then the value and practicality of such measures dramatically decreases.“Alternative arrangements” to the backstop could in theory work for a customs border. But these would need to be carefully designed and developed over time, with input from those affected, and supported by proper resources. At this stage, therefore, the arrangements proposed can offer little more than legal uncertainty for the EU and worrying disruption for cross-border traders.In his letter to Jean-Claude Juncker, Johnson presents these proposals as, far from a final demand, “the basis for rapid negotiations towards a solution”. Any proposal that would avoid costs to Britain while placing Northern Ireland’s future as collateral cannot be allowed to be the last word on the matter.• Katy Hayward is reader in sociology at

862,"Business leaders have told Boris Johnson his Brexit plan risks causing severe damage to the Northern Ireland economy and has ramped up the chance of a no-deal departure.In an angry response to the prime minister’s plan to take Britain, including Northern Ireland, out of the customs union, representatives of companies in the province and across the UK said it put jobs and growth at risk. They also said it was likely to be rejected by Brussels, raising the chances of a no-deal Brexit that would harm firms across the country.Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said Johnson had not listened to businesses, that his plan was “unworkable and unpalatable” and would make Northern Irish goods less competitive.“The measures are predicated on intrusive surveillance, which will put a burden on business and be disruptive for border communities,” he added.Ian Wright, the chief executive of the UK Food and Drink Federation, said the plans would lead to added costs for companies. He said: “It would also be bad for consumers as it would become more expensive to move goods into Northern Ireland.”Northern Ireland’s economy is highly connected with the Republic under the EU customs union regime, with a trade in goods relationship worth about £5.2bn. About a third of goods and services exports are sold to the Republic, while about a quarter of its imports come from the Republic.Under Johnson’s plan, the movement of goods would require customs checks, though he says they could be limited by alternative arrangements such as electronic paperwork and a “very small number” of physical inspections at traders’ premises.Businesses, however, said the erection of border infrastructure and new customs checks could damage the economy, hampering job creation, economic growth and exports.Ann McGregor, the chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: “It is imperative that it does not happen even for a time limited period. Businesses are telling us that the potential increased costs will seriously damage business supply lines and indeed business survival.” However, Diageo, the drinks group which makes Guinness and Baileys, moves ingredients and bottles ready for sale across the Irish border multiple times a day. It suggested any increase in border checks would necessarily be very burdensome.Its beer goes from the St James’s Gate brewery in Dublin to a packaging operation in Belfast, while cream for Baileys comes from the Republic into Northern Ireland to be turned into the finished product, before being sent back for consolidation and export.Diageo had previously estimated a hard border could cost it £1.3m, based on an estimate of an hour’s delay for each of the 18,000 beer trucks that traverse the border each year.It now believes that the burden would be much lower than that thanks to the company’s status as a “trusted trader”, with any impediment likely to be administrative rather than involving lengthy physical delays.John Glen, economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply, said about 40% of businesses were not ready for additional customs checks and that filling in forms away from the border could still result in disruption.“What if you turn up without the right documents? What happens if a lorry crosses the border without clearance? We’re a long way off being ready,” he said.• This article was amended on 3 October 2019 because an earlier version referred to 18,000 Diageo beer trucks traversing the border each day.

891,"The proposal is similar to Theresa May’s deal but with the Irish border backstop ripped up and replaced by his own plan, labelled “two borders for four years”.Under the plan the entire UK would leave the EU on 31 October with the original transition period staying in place until 31 December 2020.On the new Brexit day of 1 January 2021, Great Britain would leave all the institutions and structures of the EU including the customs union, which allows frictionless trade with all member states and all regulations on goods and food. It will also mean the UK exiting judicial structures including the European court of justice, security and defence arrangements and agreements such as data sharing.Northern Ireland would also leave the customs union on 20 December 2020. But it would remain aligned on regulations and, it is assumed, freedom of movement of people within the island of Ireland for another four years, until 2025.Yes. Goods coming into Northern Ireland would have to be checked to see if they complied with EU standards, which would apply across the island.Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland. Interactive: A typical hour in the life of the Irish borderYes. But the Democratic Unionist party has said this is a pragmatic compromise to help get a deal over the line.If Northern Ireland maintains EU regulations on food and manufactured goods and freedom of movement, there would be no need for any checks on the Irish border. This is why Johnson thinks it is a winner.Yes. But the DUP believes it will work if after 2025 new structures are put in place to give Belfast and Dublin parliamentarians oversight of how Northern Ireland moves from there, with the option of remaining aligned to EU regulations a possibility. They see the restoration of the British-Irish ministerial council as vital to this, giving representatives from the Stormont assembly (assuming it is up and running again) and the Irish parliament a say on any changes of regulations on food and manufactured goods post-2025.At first sight, no. Infrastructure on the Irish border even after an effective transition period of four years is a red line for Ireland, which is concerned it would destabilise border communities that have flourished economically and socially since peace 21 years ago.The deadline for a deal is in 10 days’ time. This will give the European commission enough time to circulate the deal among EU member states for their approval or rejection before the next EU summit on 17 October. Normally, papers that are formally discussed are circulated one week before.The DUP says it has compromised, now Dublin and Brussels should budge too. Johnson has said the EU needs to show more flexibility.Under the Benn Act passed by MPs just before Johnson prorogued parliament, the prime minister must send a letter seeking an extension to article 50 until the end of January.

921,"Jeremy Corbyn will never step aside to allow an alternative candidate to lead a caretaker government because “the rules are the rules”, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said.Opposition leaders have held a series of meetings in recent weeks to discuss how to prevent a no-deal Brexit – and have not ruled out a vote of no confidence in the government if Boris Johnson tries to force through a no-deal departure on 31 October.If Johnson loses, some MPs believe an alternative government could be formed, to extend article 50, and perhaps to trigger an EU referendum before calling a general election.The Liberal Democrats leader, Jo Swinson, has suggested Corbyn would be unlikely to secure the necessary cross-party support and should step aside in favour of a less contentious candidate.Several other names have been mooted, including the former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett and the veteran Conservative Ken Clarke, who has had the whip removed for voting against the government.But Labour rejects that idea, believing that, as leader of the opposition, Corbyn is the clear alternative prime minister. Asked if someone other than Corbyn could lead such a government, McDonnell said: “No, the rules are the rules”.He suggested Swinson might change her mind, adding: “I’m a great believer in the powers of conversion.”A senior Labour source said: “People who want a government of national unity are playing fantasy football teams. It’s absolute, complete nonsense. Not only would no such thing ever be agreed, but the idea that such a government could exist for six months with no mandate is pure, utter nonsense.”Instead, Labour is determined to push for a general election as soon as a no-deal Brexit has been averted.Several Labour MPs at Monday night’s meeting of the parliamentary Labour party told Corbyn they would prefer a referendum to be held before a general election.That argument has previously been made by the deputy leader, Tom Watson, and the idea of attaching a “confirmatory” referendum to any Brexit deal the prime minister secures from the EU27 is again being discussed. But the Labour leader has repeatedly rejected that idea.Opposition MPs and Conservative rebels banded together last month to pass the Benn Act, aimed at forcing Johnson to request a Brexit delay if he fails to pass a deal by 19 October.But the MPs have widely differing views about how that extension should be used – with some hoping Brexit can be reversed, and others that the time could be used to negotiate a deal.Instead, Labour has mooted the idea that Corbyn could lead a caretaker government for a matter of days: just long enough to request an extension to article 50 and call a general election. The SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, has repeatedly made clear that his party could support that idea.Asked whether Swinson could change her mind and support a Corbyn-led government, a Lib Dem spokesman said: “Jo is a great believer in the power of mathematics. Jeremy Corbyn does not have the numbers and needs to make clear who he would support if we need an emergency government.”Corbyn stamped his authority on Labour’s Brexit policy at last week’s party conference in Brighton, persuading delegates to back his chosen course of fighting a general election, without picking in advance which side Labour would take in a future referendum.With the Conservatives poised to campaign on the slogan “Get Brexit done”, Corbyn’s allies are concerned that becoming a remain party would jeopardise votes in leave-supporting constituencies.But several key shadow ministers, including Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, have made clear they want the party to adopt a remain position.Thornberry was dropped as Corbyn’s regular stand-in for prime minister’s questions (PMQs) after criticising the party’s message in May’s European elections.With Johnson due to deliver his party conference speech in Manchester at the same time as PMQs on Wednesday, Dominic

925,"Dover could lose £1bn worth of trade a week if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, the port has said.Doug Bannister, the chief executive at the port of Dover, told a fringe event at the Conservative conference that the government’s assumed drop in traffic under a no-deal scenario would cut £1bn a week from the flow of goods.He said the port had made extensive preparations for 31 October to function as usual but added: “That’s how critical it is. If there’s a no-deal Brexit, it’s not going to be OK. But people are doing all they can to ensure Britain keeps trading.”The transport minister, George Freeman, confirmed the government’s “planning assumption” was that no-deal disruption would roughly halve the traffic – a fall of 40%-60% – able to pass through Britain’s main trading link for three months.Dover handles £122bn a year by value, or 17% of the UK’s trade in goods. A fleet of 12 ferries carries more lorries than all other UK ports combined, on the shortest sea crossing between the UK and the EU. Freeman said he hoped goodwill would prevail if a deal was not agreed by 31 October, averting worst case disruption. Asked what preparations the government was making for “malign interventions”, such as a potential blockade by French fishermen, Freeman said he had seen cabinet papers showing that “the ministry of defence are actively looking at it”.The Freight Transport Association(FTA) said it did not expect “wholesale meltdown” but British consumers could expect to see less fresh produce. James Hookham, the deputy chief executive of the FTA, said: “There will be changes to what people can expect to see in the shops, undoubtedly.”The FTA plan to hold 140 training sessions in the next few weeks to educate hauliers about the potential paperwork needed. Hookham said questions still remained unanswered, even with the intricate flowchart issued by the Department for Transport to explain customs and border processes.“The biggest unknown in our book is what the French and EU will demand in terms of British goods imported into the EU,” he said.Hookham added that the full impact of a no-deal Brexit on Dover, Calais and Kent would probably not be seen until 4 November, due to the public holiday on 1 November.",Dover could lose £1bn of trade a week with no-deal Brexit,2019-10-01/18:06:12,dover could lose bn worth of trade a week if britain leaves the eu without a deal the port has said doug bannister the chief executive at the port of dover told a fringe event at the conservative conference that the government s assumed drop in traffic under a no deal scenario would cut bn a week from the flow of goods he said the port had made extensive preparations for  october to function as usual but added that s how critical it is if there s a no deal brexit it s not going to be ok but people are doing all they can to ensure britain keeps trading the transport minister george freeman confirmed the government s planning assumption was that no deal disruption would roughly halve the traffic a fall of   able to pass through britain s main trading link for three months dover handles bn a year by value or  of the uk s trade in goods a fleet of  ferries carries more lorries than all other uk ports combined on the shortest sea crossing between the uk and the eu freeman said he hoped goodwill would prevail if a deal was not agreed by  october averting worst case disruption asked what preparations the government was making for malign interventions such as a potential blockade by french fishermen freeman said he had seen cabinet papers showing that the ministry of defence are actively looking at it the freight transport association fta said it did not expect wholesale meltdown but british consumers could expect to see less fresh produce james hookham the deputy chief executive of the fta said there will be changes to what people can expect to see in the shops undoubtedly the fta plan to hold  training sessions in the next few weeks to educate hauliers about the potential paperwork needed hookham said questions still remained unanswered even with the intricate flowchart issued by the department for transport to explain customs and border processes the biggest unknown in our book is what the french and eu will demand in terms of british goods imported into the eu he said hookham added that the full impact of a no deal brexit on dover calais and kent would probably not be seen until  november due to the public holiday on  november ,Brexit,0.17723113298416138
934,"It is agreed by all that this is the moment of truth. When Michel Barnier privately warned the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, last Friday that he needed firm proposals imminently for a revised Brexit deal to have a chance of being agreed by leaders at an EU summit on 17 October, Barclay concurred, according to leaked minutes seen by the Guardian.For the UK to have a hope of ratification by 31 October, the gears in Whitehall needed to not merely whir but to mesh with the cogwheels in Brussels within days. During a blizzard of media rounds on Tuesday morning, Boris Johnson agreed that he would know by this weekend whether a deal was possible.The broad parameters of what the UK is proposing have started to become visible in recent days. The prime minister rightly points to his proposal of a single agri-food zone on the island of Ireland as a significant shift from his mantra during the Tory leadership campaign position that the Irish backstop had to be ditched in its entirety.The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU’s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.Daniel BoffeyIndeed, Johnson has suggested that the single regulatory zone for agricultural goods should be permanent, citing Ian Paisley’s refrain that the people of Northern Ireland may be British but its cattle are Irish. This would avoid the need for sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks on the Irish border for 30% of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and 70% of it by flow.EU sources say there are also signs that if a mechanism can be found for gaining the consent of the people of Northern Ireland then a temporary single-regulatory zone on the island of Ireland could be agreed for manufactured goods.It is understood that Barnier told Barclay on Friday that he was willing to talk about consent, or governance as the EU negotiator described it, once the UK government made its move on the scope of the single regulatory zone. They could jump together.Could that be the route to agreeing a time limit on regulatory alignment in manufactured goods? A role could be found for Stormont in agreeing to continued alignment after a period four years – up to the point by which the rest of the UK may be diverging. The “germ of an idea” of a single SPS zone, as Johnson described it, could be flowering into something more significant.But that leaves the big issue of customs – precisely the issue that tormented Theresa May.The government has been creditably clear that it will not sign up to a deal that leaves Northern Ireland outside its customs territory. May told the Commons that no British prime minister could agree to such a proposal and Johnson has said the whole of the UK must leave the EU as one customs territory.The customs non-paper submitted to the European commission by the UK has caused a kerfuffle because it spells out the logical consequence of that: customs checks and controls on the island of Ireland.The strawman reported by Irish broadcasters is a string of custom clearance centres five to 10 miles from the border. That has been an easy suggestion to knock back. The UK is instead looking at what it describes as a light-touch customs regime.The customs authorities would use GPS for the real-time tracking of goods and freight traffic over the border, with the paperwork carried out in advance.Trusted traders, and small and medium-sized businesses that benefit from exemptions, would in the most part cross through without trouble, but customs authorities would electronically flag those down who cause any concern. They could be asked to report to a designated centre or, more likely, be checked at their own premises.The UK has suggested the Republic of Ireland could mirror those arrangements, with close border control cooperation between customs authorities on both sides.But, if that is the big idea, this moment of truth is likely to be a sobering one. The EU says you cannot decouple customs and regulatory checks because it is through customs returns that goods are followed. It argues that the exemptions for many traders would open the door to smuggling. It is claimed that the supervision required in such circumstances would be destabilising to both the Irish economy and peace.So where to go next? The ratification of a deal will rely on a significant U-turn by Johnson, and a major concession by the EU. Johnson needs to accept that Northern Ireland will remain in the EU’s customs territory – but for a temporary period. Dublin needs to be persuaded that such a time limit is better than a no-deal Brexit now.There is no guarantee of success in parliament, despite some hopeful signs from the DUP and Tory Brexit “Spartans”.

954,"Boris Johnson’s secret plans to solve the Irish border Brexit challenge involve customs sites on both sides of the border and real-time tracking devices on lorries, it has been reported.The ideas, which mark a departure from his promise not to put infrastructure on the border, are part of four unofficial papers submitted by the UK to Brussels by Johnson’s team.The broadcaster RTÉ, which has had sight of the the tightly guarded proposals, is reporting that customs clearance sites would be sited five to 10 miles from the border to the north and the south to deal with imports and exports.Traders would have the choice of lodging their papers at these sites, similar to the ones that existed before the single market came into existence, or electing to be tracked electronically in an online “transit” arrangement.The idea of permanent clearance sites on both sides of the border, even five to 10 miles away, and real-time tracking of the movements of goods are unlikely to be supported by the Irish government.A spokesman for Downing Street said: “Nothing we are proposing involves checks or controls at the border. That is an absolute commitment.”A government source said the report was a misrepresentation of the “non-paper”, which discussed customs checks at place of origin or destination of goods.Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland. Interactive: A typical hour in the life of the Irish borderIn the limited cases that inspections were needed, physical checks could be at dedicated premises, factories or production sites, the source suggested.But Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, dismissed the proposals as a “non-starter”, and called for a “serious proposal” from the UK.Non-Paper = Non-Starter. Time the EU had a serious proposal from the UK Govt if a #Brexit deal is to be achievable in October. NI and IRE deserves better!Sinn Féin in Ireland and the Social Democratic and Labour party in Northern Ireland also dismissed the plans on Monday night. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said they were “absolutely out of the question”, while SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “It doesn’t matter if it’s a mile, five miles or 10 miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are unacceptable.”Labour said the proposals were “utterly unworkable”. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: “They would place an enormous administrative burden on businesses and rely on technology that does not yet exist.“Crucially, if true, they represent a rowing back on the commitments made to the people of Northern Ireland two years ago that there would be no return to a hard border or related checks or controls.”The leak comes as Johnson puts his finishing touches on formal written proposals expected to go to Brussels in the next week for a revised Brexit deal.Although all the indications are that a large gap remains in thinking, signs have emerged that the hardline position of the Conservative party’s most Eurosceptic backbenchers has softened just days before Boris Johnson’s team are due to enter a “tunnel” of secret negotiations with Brussels.Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, has opened the door to a potential Brexit deal, indicating he would look at one even if it included a version of the controversial Irish border backstop to which the Eurosceptic ERG was once implacably opposed.During a heated and sometimes bad-tempered event on the party conference fringe, he indicated that the “Spartan” wing of the party was in the mood for a deal.“It has been sometimes been said that we will vote against anything regardless. That’s not true,” he said referring to the bloc of 28 backbenchers who voted against Theresa May’s Brexit deal three times.“If there is some form of deal, be it over the backstop or anything else, then I and my colleagues will look at it and read it very carefully, because at the end of the day you are talking about international treaty law. So I’ll look at a deal if there is one,” he said.Francois’ comments were seen as a subtle shift in approach for the ERG, whose support could unlock a deal for Johnson.The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period.

If it really means we don’t, then I will vote against it and if we don’t no amount of browbeating will make me change my mind.”His remarks follow weeks of shifting mood over the Irish backstop. The Democratic Unionist party, which was implacably opposed to the backstop, has also indicated it was in the mood for a deal. It is understood that the DUP has been consulted on the plans that Johnson is to take to Brussels next week.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, also hinted last week that there could be amendments to the withdrawal agreement but warned there was still a huge gap between the UK and Irish positions.The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said she would look at the possibility of a backstop with a time limit but warned that agreeing to consider one was not the same as “advocating” one.She told the Bruges Group: “It would be good to get rid of the iniquitous backstop” but added that it would be “good to get a deal”.She called for space to be given to negotiators, who now have fewer than 17 days to come up with a deal before the next EU summit.",Boris Johnson's 'secret Irish border plans' dismissed

1022,"The UK’s most senior civil servant is under pressure to investigate Boris Johnson’s financial backers following cross-party claims that unnamed individuals stand to benefit from the prime minister’s willingness to pursue a no-deal Brexit.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has written to the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, asking if there may be a conflict of interest in Johnson’s acceptance of support from hedge funds that could gain from an economic shock.Earlier on Saturday, Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, suggested Johnson was pursuing the interests of financial backers set to gain from a no-deal Brexit, in a major escalation of tensions in the prime minister’s own party.Hammond said he was repeating a comment made last week by Rachel Johnson, the prime minister’s sister.The former chancellor was accused by senior Tories of attempting a “smear” without evidence. However, Hammond was supported on Saturday by a series of MPs from across the Commons. “Johnson is backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit – and there is only one option that works for them: a crash-out no-deal that sends the currency tumbling and inflation soaring,” Hammond wrote in the Times.Downing Street has refused to comment on the claim.Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister who was thrown out of the party for opposing a no-deal Brexit, said: “The dubious financiers who supported the ‘leave’ campaign and the prime minister’s leadership campaign are betting against Britain. The PM should put the interests of the country first rather than facilitating a financial bonanza for a few.”Anna Soubry, the leader of Change UK, said: “This week’s events are damning evidence that Boris Johnson has no moral compass. It gives me no pleasure to believe that Johnson is in hock to all manner of people and in particular those who don’t give a toss about the livelihoods of our constituents but simply get even more rich gambling on our children’s future.”However, the business minister Nadhim Zahawi said Hammond was peddling a conspiracy. “Philip you let yourself down by claiming speculators on ‘no deal’ are interfering in us leaving the EU,” he tweeted. “This is an ugly smear that is completely untrue. If you know anything about finance or the City then you will know that.”Hammond and his team have not named any individual donors. However, hedge fund managers have backed Johnson. One of those is Crispin Odey, a fund manager who has also previously backed Vote Leave and Ukip. Over the summer, it was reported that his fund had made a £300m bet against British businesses and stood to profit from an economic slump in the UK. However, the fund also backed other British companies. Odey did not respond to a request for comment.McDonnell said: “Given widespread concerns raised by the former chancellor Philip Hammond’s comment today about Johnson’s speculator sponsors profiteering from a no-deal Brexit, I am writing to Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, to seek a Cabinet Office investigation into this potential conflict of interest.”The conflict of interest code for members of the House of Commons states: “Given that service in parliament is a public trust … members are expected … to fulfil their public duties with honesty and uphold the highest standards so as to avoid real or apparent conflicts of interests, and maintain and enhance public confidence and trust in the integrity of each member and in the House of Commons.”",Calls for inquiry into claims Johnson backers benefit from no-deal Brexit,2019-09-28/17:06:27,the uk s most senior civil servant is under pressure to investigate boris johnson s financial backers following cross party claims that unnamed individuals stand to benefit from the prime minister s willingness to pursue a no deal brexit john mcdonnell the shadow chancellor has written to the cabinet secretary sir mark sedwill asking if there may be a conflict of interest in johnson s acceptance of support from hedge funds that could gain from an economic shock earlier on saturday philip hammond the former chancellor suggested johnson was pursuing the interests of financial backers set to gain from a no deal brexit in a major escalation of tensions in the prime minister s own party hammond said he was repeating a comment made last week by rachel johnson the prime minister s sister the former chancellor was accused by senior tories of attempting a smear without evidence however hammond was supported on saturday by a series of mps from across the commons johnson is backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard brexit and there is only one option that works for them a crash out no deal that sends the currency tumbling and inflation soaring hammond wrote in the times downing street has refused to comment on the claim guto bebb a former tory minister who was thrown out of the party for opposing a no deal brexit said the dubious financiers who supported the leave campaign and the prime minister s leadership campaign are betting against britain the pm should put the interests of the country first rather than facilitating a financial bonanza for a few anna soubry the leader of change uk said this week s events are damning evidence that boris johnson has no moral compass it gives me no pleasure to believe that johnson is in hock to all manner of people and in particular those who don t give a toss about the livelihoods of our constituents but simply get even more rich gambling on our children s future however the business minister nadhim zahawi said hammond was peddling a conspiracy philip you let yourself down by claiming speculators on no deal are interfering in us leaving the eu he tweeted this is an ugly smear that is completely untrue if you know anything about finance or the city then you will know that hammond and his team have not named any individual donors however hedge fund managers have backed johnson one of those is crispin odey a fund manager who has also previously backed vote leave and ukip over the summer it was reported that his fund had made a m bet against british businesses and stood to profit from an economic slump in the uk however the fund also backed other british companies odey did not respond to a request for comment mcdonnell said given widespread concerns raised by the former chancellor philip hammond s comment today about johnson s speculator sponsors profiteering from a no deal brexit i am writing to mark sedwill the cabinet secretary to seek a cabinet office investigation into this potential conflict of interest the conflict of interest code for members of the house of commons states given that service in parliament is a public trust members are expected to fulfil their public duties with honesty and uphold the highest standards so as to avoid real or apparent conflicts of interests and maintain and enhance public confidence and trust in the integrity of each member and in the house of commons ,Brexit,0.23445981740951538
1046,"A defiant Boris Johnson will use this weekend’s Tory conference in Manchester to double down on his “people v parliament” rhetoric, after a tumultuous week in which he was accused of dangerously inflaming political tensions.Downing Street insiders insist they have not been blown off course by the furious condemnation of Johnson’s repeated use of the phrase “surrender bill” to describe the backbench Benn Act.Instead, they claim they will use party conference to drive home their “Get Brexit Done” slogan, launch a string of manifesto-friendly policies – and attack Jeremy Corbyn as too weak to lead Britain.Johnson’s unapologetic stance comes after Amber Rudd joined the chorus of condemnation against his aggressive use of language, saying she was “disappointed and stunned”, and warning it could incite violence against opponents.The prime minister still hopes to press ahead with somehow securing a Brexit deal in the brief window remaining before the 17 October European Council – and push it through parliament, against the backdrop of political turmoil.Despite the horror with which many Labour MPs greeted Johnson’s bellicose performance in the Commons on Wednesday, No 10 still believes there will be intense pressure on those MPs who represent leave constituencies to support a deal.“If we came back with a deal, I think there would be real political pressure to really push through: if you’re in a Brexit seat, do you really want to go into an election having rejected Brexit?” the government source said.Meanwhile, Johnson will try and use his conference platform to attack parliament for attempting to thwart his negotiating strategy – and switch the focus back to domestic policy announcements, including on the NHS, law and order and the cost of living.Internal polling is telling the Tories that the prime minister is now more trusted than Corbyn on the NHS, and the Labour leader is regarded as weak – a message they plan to hammer home ruthlessly in the weeks ahead.They believe Johnson would perform well in head-to-head debates with Corbyn, despite their one clash at prime minister’s questions being widely regarded as a win for the Labour leader. “We’ll be cock a hoop,” said the government source. “We’ll have 10 a day, stick them in.”Theresa May also hoped to capitalise on questions about Corbyn’s leadership during the 2017 general election campaign, at one point warning he would go “naked into the negotiating chamber” for Brexit talks. But the electorate responded by stripping the Tories of their majority.Labour strategists are battling to find the best way of burnishing Corbyn’s anti-establishment credentials, as Johnson tries to paint himself as the champion of the people against scheming MPs. They say the slogan “people v privilege”, trailed at Labour conference in Brighton, strikes a chord with voters in focus groups.Rudd, who quit the government and resigned the Conservative whip earlier this month in protest at the prime minister’s policies, also told the Evening Standard that she might stand in London as an “independent Conservative” at the next general election.Amid bitter complaints about Johnson’s use of words such as “surrender” and “betrayal” over Brexit, and his subsequent refusal to apologise, Rudd said she had been “disappointed and stunned” when the PM dismissed the fears of female MPs about a possible repeat of the 2016 murder of Jo Cox.Asked about the Downing Street approach of couching Brexit as a battle between the people and a remain-minded parliament, Rudd said: “The sort of language I’m afraid we’ve seen more and more of coming out from No 10 does incite violence. It’s the sort of language people think legitimises a more aggressive approach and sometimes violence.”Comparing Johnson’s approach to that of Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential election, Rudd said “the casual approach to safety of MPs and their staff [was] immoral”, and urged ministers to “consider their own judgments rather than be desperately loyal”.Rudd is not planning to attend conference; but some of the other 21 rebels who had the whip removed for voting for the Benn Act do plan to attend, including former justice secretary David Gauke.The House of Commons voted against granting the government a three-day break so that conference could be held; but Johnson plans to press ahead, leaving one junior “duty minister” for each department behind in London.He is expected to deliver his set-piece conference speech as planned on Wednesday, leaving Dominic Raab to stand in for prime minister’s questions back in London.Meanwhile opposition MPs hoping to thwart Boris Johnson’s Brexit strategy will spend next week working on a fresh anti no-deal action plan.If the prime minister breaks the terms of the Benn Act, which compels him to ask for an extension to Article 50 if he can’t get a Brexit deal, they want to be able to implement a plan “within minutes”.The legislation, spearheaded by Labour MP Hilary Benn, and backed by Labour and rebel ex-Tories including former chancellor Phillip Hammond, demands that the prime minister ask Brussels for an extension to the Brexit process by 19 October if he has not brokered a new agreement.However, they insist they will not seek to wreck the Tory conference by attempting to take over the order paper, or table new laws and emergency debates.In the first vote Johnson faces as prime minister, 21 rebel Tory MPs vote with the opposition to seize control of the order paper to allow a debate on a bill that would block a no-deal Brexit. Against Johnson's wishes, the Commons passes  by 329 votes to 300 the second reading of the European Union (withdrawal) (No 6) bill proposed by Hilary Benn.Later the same day the Benn bill passes the third and final reading needed to become law, this time by 327 to 299 votes.Johnson responds by attempting to force an early general election. The 298 MPs who support him are short of the two-thirds majority required by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, making it a third defeat in a single day for the government.Dominic Grieve's bid to force the government to release documents related to the Operation Yellowhammer no-deal planning and on the decision to prorogue parliament defeats Johnson by 311 to 302.Johnson's second call for an early general election is supported by 293 MPs, still short of the two-thirds majority required. Parliament is prorogued and MPs briefly occupy the chamber after the session is closed. The supreme court rules that Johnson's closure of parliament was unlawful and that MPs must return.In the first vote in the reconvened House of Commons, MPs vote by 306 to 289 against a three-day recess to allow Conservative MPs to attend their party conference.On a rare Saturday sitting of parliament, the government loses a vote on the ‘Letwin amendment’ by 322 votes to 306. It withholds approval of the prime minister’s deal until the legislation to enact it - the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - is passed.Having won with a 30-vote majority to move his Withdrawal Agreement Bill to the second reading stage, Johnson immediately lost the government’s so-called programme motion, which set out the accelerated timetable for the bill, by 308 votes in favour to 322 against.Instead, they are expected to pepper ministers with a host of urgent questions instead. A source close to the rebels said: “Next week is all about planning scenarios for if Boris Johnson breaks the law.”“It’s going to be the cross-party group meeting to work out what action could be taken in the event Johnson does break the law.”They said this could involve legislation but have also not ruled out another confidence vote in the Prime Minister, that could in theory trigger a general election.Meetings among the group of politicians working to stop no-deal, including Labour’s shadow Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, the then Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster David Lidington and former chancellor Philip Hammond, representatives of the Liberal Democrats and SNP took place as early as June.",Defiant Johnson will not tone down rhetoric at Tory

1098,"Brexit party members earn more from second jobs than any other group in the European parliament, according to transparency campaigners who are warning about potential conflicts of interest.An annual study by Transparency International showed that Nigel Farage is no longer the best-paid British MEP by second job. Now in seventh place among the 227 MEPs with outside earnings, Farage earns about €360,000 (£319,000) a year from his media company, Thorn in the Side.The Brexit party’s London member Ben Habib is the EU’s best-paid MEP. Elected in May, Habib declared €960,000 annual earnings from First Property Group, the property fund manager he founded.Three other Brexit party MEPs make the top 10 ahead of Farage. At No 3 is Ann Widdecombe, who declared a second income of €240,000-€480,000 a year. The former Tory minister and reality TV contestant makes between €5,000 and €10,000 a month writing her Daily Express column, with a further €20,000 a month coming in from speaking and broadcasting.The Brexit party chairman, Richard Tice, has annual earnings of between €264,000 and €360,000 from his business interests.In 12th place is the Conservative Brexit evangelist Daniel Hannan, who is paid at least €5,000 a month to advise the machinery manufacturer JCB. Chaired by the Brexit-supporting Lord Bamford, JCB paid Boris Johnson £10,000 in January and has also had the former Brexit secretary David Davis on the payroll.Another prominent name in the top 10 is the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, who earns between €180,000 and €426,000 for sitting on company boards and giving speeches.All the outside earnings figures cited were before tax. Transparency International said the Brexit party contingent were “the top earners by a long way”, with its 28 MEPs earning a total of between €2m and €4.7m on top of their monthly MEP salaries of €6,825 after tax.The exact figures are unknown, as MEPs are only required to declare outside earnings in approximate amounts. The study reports MEPs annual earnings, but if Brexit goes ahead on 31 October, British MEPs would have sat for only four months of the current five-year term.About a third of the parliament’s 748 sitting MEPs declared income from second jobs.“Based on some of the details, including in some of the declarations of the Brexit party, it is impossible to judge what some of these companies are engaged in and therefore the exercise of determining if there is a potential conflict of interest is impossible to undertake,” said Nick Aiossa of Transparency International’s Brussels office. “Particularly with the sums of money involved with the Brexit party.”The group argues that the current system is too lax, fears fuelled by revelations that Farage failed to declare lavish funding from the Brexit tycoon Arron Banks.Aiossa said that MEPs breaking the European parliament’s code of conduct in previous years had never faced sanctions. “There is simply no deterrent for MEPs to take this exercise seriously,” he said. “Until there is a sanctions regime that accompanies an ethics reform … we will continue to see declarations that are misleading, incomplete or fail to record [important details].”The Brexit party did not respond directly to questions about a potential conflict of interest, but issued a statement from the West Midlands MEP Rupert Lowe, who has the fourth-highest income from a second job. He earns between €204,000 and €444,000 from companies including a business running cancer treatment centres and another involved in solar energy.“Isn’t it wonderful that Brexit party MEPs earn more money than arch-federalist Guy Verhofstadt, and get a lot more votes than him as well,” said Lowe, who is one place ahead of the Belgian MEP.“Many Brexit party MEPs are successful in the work that they do, the decisions they make, and the earnings list reflects that fact. It’s important that voters who wish to attain the goal of leaving the EU have capable, experienced people to represent them to the best of their ability.”A spokesman for Verhofstadt said he had “nothing against the establishment of an ethics body as proposed [by Transparency International]”.","Brexit party MEPs are EU's biggest earners in second jobs, study finds",2019-09-26/15:23:37,brexit party members earn more from second jobs than any other group in the european parliament according to transparency campaigners who are warning about potential conflicts of interest an annual study by transparency international showed that nigel farage is no longer the best paid british mep by second job now in seventh place among the  meps with outside earnings farage earns about     a year from his media company thorn in the side the brexit party s london member ben habib is the eu s best paid mep elected in may habib declared   annual earnings from first property group the property fund manager he founded three other brexit party meps make the top  ahead of farage at no  is ann widdecombe who declared a second income of     a year the former tory minister and reality tv contestant makes between   and   a month writing her daily express column with a further   a month coming in from speaking and broadcasting the brexit party chairman richard tice has annual earnings of between   and   from his business interests in th place is the conservative brexit evangelist daniel hannan who is paid at least   a month to advise the machinery manufacturer jcb chaired by the brexit supporting lord bamford jcb paid boris johnson   in january and has also had the former brexit secretary david davis on the payroll another prominent name in the top  is the european parliament s brexit coordinator guy verhofstadt who earns between   and   for sitting on company boards and giving speeches all the outside earnings figures cited were before tax transparency international said the brexit party contingent were the top earners by a long way with its  meps earning a total of between m and  m on top of their monthly mep salaries of   after tax the exact figures are unknown as meps are only required to declare outside earnings in approximate amounts the study reports meps annual earnings but if brexit goes ahead on  october british meps would have sat for only four months of the current five year term about a third of the parliament s  sitting meps declared income from second jobs based on some of the details including in some of the declarations of the brexit party it is impossible to judge what some of these companies are engaged in and therefore the exercise of determining if there is a potential conflict of interest is impossible to undertake said nick aiossa of transparency international s brussels office particularly with the sums of money involved with the brexit party the group argues that the current system is too lax fears fuelled by revelations that farage failed to declare lavish funding from the brexit tycoon arron banks aiossa said that meps breaking the european parliament s code of conduct in previous years had never faced sanctions there is simply no deterrent for meps to take this exercise seriously he said until there is a sanctions regime that accompanies an ethics reform we will continue to see declarations that are misleading incomplete or fail to record important details the brexit party did not respond directly to questions about a potential conflict of interest but issued a statement from the west midlands mep rupert lowe who has the fourth highest income from a second job he earns between   and   from companies including a business running cancer treatment centres and another involved in solar energy isn t it wonderful that brexit party meps earn more money than arch federalist guy verhofstadt and get a lot more votes than him as well said lowe who is one place ahead of the belgian mep many brexit party meps are successful in the work that they do the decisions they make and the earnings list reflects that fact it s important that voters who wish to attain the goal of leaving the eu have capable experienced people to represent them to the best of their ability a spokesman for verhofstadt said he had nothing against the establishment of an ethics body as proposed by transparency international ,Brexit,0.12171424180269241
1156,"European media had few words harsh enough for a British prime minister they portrayed as unscrupulous, autocratic and dishonest – and few warm enough for the judges whose defence of British parliamentary democracy had brought him low.Germany’s Die Zeit said the supreme court’s ruling that Boris Johnson’s five-week suspension of parliament was unlawful was “devastating” for the prime minister. In fact, it said, “all that is left for him is to resign. Unfortunately, he has repeatedly shown over the past few months that law and order are of little interest to him.”There may never have been a British prime minister who has sought to overrule the primacy of parliament like Johnson, the paper said, “a prime minister who has lied to the people, parliament and the crown, and abuses his power without a care”.Johnson is simply “not the right person to lead Britain in such a major crisis”, it concluded. “If Brexit is not done legally and in accordance with the constitution, Britain will never find peace. The people must now decide what they want, either in the form of new elections or a second referendum.”Die Welt said the judges’ decision had “erupted like a volcano”. Johnson, defeated multiple times in parliament, had now lost, heavily, before the law. “One wonders whether and how he can continue, at the head of a minority government and discredited by the supreme court,” it said.Handelsblatt said the judges’ verdict was “crushing, and unanimous”. The court’s reasoning was laid out with “incorruptible, merciless logic and in the end, its verdict seemed inevitable – and the government’s argument was pulverised”.Above and beyond the consequences for Johnson and Brexit, the ruling showed Britain needs a written constitution. “Otherwise unscrupulous leaders like Johnson can abuse it anytime. Parliament must be able to decide for itself when it meets.”In a stinging editorial, the Irish Times said a central plank of Johnson’s “carefully cultivated self-image” had always been the claim that “behind the buffoonish exterior was a skilful, serious-minded tactician … But in just two months in Downing St, that illusion has unravelled. Johnson, it is painfully clear, is winging it.”The paper said the ruling was his “biggest humiliation of all”. The judges had “broken new constitutional ground” with their “powerful assertion of parliamentary sovereignty and robust rebuke to those who trample on it”, and their decision had left Johnson “backed into a corner, his options narrowing and his time running out.”.In France, Le Monde said the word “historic” was no exaggeration: “The supreme court has taken a decision that will stay long in the annals of British politics,” it said. Certainly, the ruling was “a monumental blow to Boris Johnson, whose authority now seems seriously weakened”.But beyond that, in a country without a written constitution, the court’s 11 judges “made history by considerably reinforcing British parliamentary democracy, and defining very clearly the balance of powers between parliament and government”.The paper said the decision made the prospect of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October even more unlikely. “How, after such a heavy judicial defeat, could Johnson defy the law obliging him to seek a delay if there is no agreement with Brussels by 18 October?”Libération said the most likely scenario now was probably “a vote of no confidence leading to fresh elections and, of course, to a new Brexit delay”. Johnson, however, is still insisting that the UK “will leave the EU on 31 October, come what may”.British prime ministers, the paper said, “have all, these past three years, been afflicted with the same syndrome: that of endlessly repeating the same empty phrases without ever resolving Brexit – whose outcome, despite all the political drama, has still not been found.”Spain’s El País said in an editorial an “autocratic and populist ruler” had been severely admonished for attacking parliamentary democracy. The 11 supreme court judges had done “great service to the cause of democracy, far beyond the borders of their small Atlantic island”, it said.In the Netherlands, De Volkskrant said “few had expected such a unanimous and harsh judgement, which was hailed as a victory for the rule of law”. Johnson and his top adviser, Dominic Cummings, had been reminded in no uncertain terms by 11 judges that their “people versus the established order” strategy “may work for a campaign like Vote Leave, but running a country is different”, it said.But, the paper added, the judges’ spectacular statement was “not a solution to the political crisis”. The prime minister has no majority in parliament, but “at the same time, parliament is reluctant to let the government fall for fear of new elections and the risk that the UK will fall out of the EU without a deal”.",'A monumental blow': European papers respond to Boris Johnson's defeat in court,2019-09-25/10:16:58,european media had few words harsh enough for a british prime minister they portrayed as unscrupulous autocratic and dishonest and few warm enough for the judges whose defence of british parliamentary democracy had brought him low germany s die zeit said the supreme court s ruling that boris johnson s five week suspension of parliament was unlawful was devastating for the prime minister in fact it said all that is left for him is to resign unfortunately he has repeatedly shown over the past few months that law and order are of little interest to him there may never have been a british prime minister who has sought to overrule the primacy of parliament like johnson the paper said a prime minister who has lied to the people parliament and the crown and abuses his power without a care johnson is simply not the right person to lead britain in such a major crisis it concluded if brexit is not done legally and in accordance with the constitution britain will never find peace the people must now decide what they want either in the form of new elections or a second referendum die welt said the judges decision had erupted like a volcano johnson defeated multiple times in parliament had now lost heavily before the law one wonders whether and how he can continue at the head of a minority government and discredited by the supreme court it said handelsblatt said the judges verdict was crushing and unanimous the court s reasoning was laid out with incorruptible merciless logic and in the end its verdict seemed inevitable and the government s argument was pulverised above and beyond the consequences for johnson and brexit the ruling showed britain needs a written constitution otherwise unscrupulous leaders like johnson can abuse it anytime parliament must be able to decide for itself when it meets in a stinging editorial the irish times said a central plank of johnson s carefully cultivated self image had always been the claim that behind the buffoonish exterior was a skilful serious minded tactician but in just two months in downing st that illusion has unravelled johnson it is painfully clear is winging it the paper said the ruling was his biggest humiliation of all the judges had broken new constitutional ground with their powerful assertion of parliamentary sovereignty and robust rebuke to those who trample on it and their decision had left johnson backed into a corner his options narrowing and his time running out in france le monde said the word historic was no exaggeration the supreme court has taken a decision that will stay long in the annals of british politics it said certainly the ruling was a monumental blow to boris johnson whose authority now seems seriously weakened but beyond that in a country without a written constitution the court s  judges made history by considerably reinforcing british parliamentary democracy and defining very clearly the balance of powers between parliament and government the paper said the decision made the prospect of a no deal brexit on  october even more unlikely how after such a heavy judicial defeat could johnson defy the law obliging him to seek a delay if there is no agreement with brussels by  october libération said the most likely scenario now was probably a vote of no confidence leading to fresh elections and of course to a new brexit delay johnson however is still insisting that the uk will leave the eu on  october come what may british prime ministers the paper said have all these past three years been afflicted with the same syndrome that of endlessly repeating the same empty phrases without ever resolving brexit whose outcome despite all the political drama has still not been found spain s el país said in an editorial an autocratic and populist ruler had been severely admonished for attacking parliamentary democracy the  supreme court judges had done great service to the cause of democracy far beyond the borders of their small atlantic island it said in the netherlands de volkskrant said few had expected such a unanimous and harsh judgement which was hailed as a victory for the rule of law johnson and his top adviser dominic cummings had been reminded in no uncertain terms by  judges that their people versus the established order strategy may work for a campaign like vote leave but running a country is different it said but the paper added the judges spectacular statement was not a solution to the political crisis the prime minister has no majority in parliament but at the same time parliament is reluctant to let the government fall for fear of new elections and the risk that the uk will fall out of the eu without a deal ,Brexit,0.23706813156604767
1158,"Jeremy Corbyn has called for Boris Johnson to apologise to the Queen and the country for unlawfully suspending parliament to stop scrutiny of his Brexit strategy.The Labour leader said the prime minister had abused the powers he has of the use of the royal prerogative and this was a very, very serious matter.Speaking on the BBC Today programme, Corbyn said it should have been obvious that it was a “pretty risky” decision to suspend parliament and reiterated his call for Johnson to resign.“I think he should apologise to her [the Queen] for the advice he gave her and more importantly he should apologise to the British people for what he has done in trying to shut down our democracy at a crucial time when people are worried about what will happen on 31 October,” he said.“Thanks to the supreme court, we now have parliament meeting again today and we will once again be able to question the government in what it is actually doing in taking us out of the EU without a deal, with all the damage that will do to people’s jobs and livelihoods,” he added.Despite his calls for Johnson to resign, Corbyn said he would only move to a vote of no confidence in the prime minister when it was clear that a no-deal Brexit was off the table.“Quite simply our first priority is to prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October,” he said.Michael Gove, the minister responsible for no-deal planning, took a defiant tone on the judgment on Tuesday morning, saying he respected the supreme court ruling but did not agree with it.Asked whether the government had been wrong to prorogue parliament, Gove said: “I don’t think so.”“I don’t think the government should apologise for having a strong domestic agenda or seeking to ring about or exit from the European Union,” he added.Gove also denied widespread reports that Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, had in cabinet criticised the judgment as a “constitutional coup”, saying he did not recognise that language.Elsewhere, the government was sending mixed messages on its response to the judgment, with a senior No 10 source briefing the view that judges had made a mistake, while Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, called for the independence of the judges to be respected.“It is important, once again, to emphasise that these cases are not about when and on what terms the United Kingdom is to leave the European Union. They are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to Her Majesty the Queen on 27 or 28 August, that parliament should be prorogued from a date between 9 and 12 September until 14 October, was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not.”“The first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister’s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable. This court holds that it is. The courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.““It prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October. Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess. While parliament is prorogued, neither house can meet, debate or pass legislation. Neither house can debate government policy. Nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees…This prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances: the fundamental change which was due to take place in the constitution of the United Kingdom on 31 October. Parliament, and in particular the House of Commons as the elected representatives of the people, has a right to a voice in how that change comes about. The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.”“The court is bound to conclude, therefore, that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.““This court has already concluded that the prime minister’s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the royal commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.”“It is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker, to decide what to do next. Unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware, they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible. It is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister, but if it is, the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court.”The full judgment and the summary judgment can be downloaded from the Supreme court website.Parliament will reconvene at 11.30am on Wednesday, with all parties whipping their MPs to be there.Opposition parties are likely to start making moves to hold the government to account through motions that would seek to gain control of the Commons order paper and possibly a motion or humble address to get publication of the attorney general’s legal advice on prorogation.The government will shortly want to table a motion to secure a short recess for the Tory party conference but the vote may be lost by the government as Johnson no longer has a majority.Corbyn said Labour would vote against parliament breaking up again at such a crucial time for

not recognise that language elsewhere the government was sending mixed messages on its response to the judgment with a senior no  source briefing the view that judges had made a mistake while robert buckland the justice secretary called for the independence of the judges to be respected it is important once again to emphasise that these cases are not about when and on what terms the united kingdom is to leave the european union they are only about whether the advice given by the prime minister to her majesty the queen on  or  august that parliament should be prorogued from a date between  and  september until  october was lawful and the legal consequences if it was not the first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister s advice to her majesty is justiciable this court holds that it is the courts have exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries it prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on  october proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess while parliament is prorogued neither house can meet debate or pass legislation neither house can debate government policy nor may members ask written or oral questions of ministers or meet and take evidence in committees this prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances the fundamental change which was due to take place in the constitution of the united kingdom on  october parliament and in particular the house of commons as the elected representatives of the people has a right to a voice in how that change comes about the effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme the court is bound to conclude therefore that the decision to advise her majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification this court has already concluded that the prime minister s advice to her majesty was unlawful void and of no effect this means that the order in council to which it led was also unlawful void and of no effect and should be quashed this means that when the royal commissioners walked into the house of lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper the prorogation was also void and of no effect parliament has not been prorogued this is the unanimous judgment of all  justices it is for parliament and in particular the speaker and the lord speaker to decide what to do next unless there is some parliamentary rule of which we are unaware they can take immediate steps to enable each house to meet as soon as possible it is not clear to us that any step is needed from the prime minister but if it is the court is pleased that his counsel have told the court that he will take all necessary steps to comply with the terms of any declaration made by this court the full judgment and the summary judgment can be downloaded from the supreme court website parliament will reconvene at  am on wednesday with all parties whipping their mps to be there opposition parties are likely to start making moves to hold the government to account through motions that would seek to gain control of the commons order paper and possibly a motion or humble address to get publication of the attorney general s legal advice on prorogation the government will shortly want to table a motion to secure a short recess for the tory party conference but the vote may be lost by the government as johnson no longer has a majority corbyn said labour would vote against parliament breaking

1185,"The UK supreme court ruling against Boris Johnson was celebrated in EU capitals and has left Brussels convinced that the prime minister has lost control of events and will not be able to crash Britain out on 31 October.As Lady Hale, the president of the UK’s highest court, read out its unanimous judgment, politicians, officials and diplomats involved in the Brexit talks spoke of their reassurance about the state of the rule of law in the UK.The decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks in order to avoid parliamentary scrutiny had already provoked criticism by senior politicians in the European parliament, and the court’s confirmation on Tuesday that Johnson’s move was unlawful was welcomed.Guy Verhofstadt, the EU parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: “At least one big relief in the Brexit saga: the rule of law in the UK is alive & kicking.“Parliaments should never be silenced in a real democracy. I never want to hear Boris Johnson or any other Brexiteer say again that the European Union is undemocratic.”The European parliament’s speaker, David Sassoli, said: “Important decision from UK supreme court to rule prorogation of parliament as unlawful.“Any Brexit agreement needs to be approved by both UK and EU parliament, so proper democratic scrutiny on both sides of the Channel is essential.”The chair of the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee, Norbert Röttgen, who is a senior member of Angela Merkel’s CDU party, expressed his satisfaction at the judgment.He said: “It is not my place to comment on judicial proceedings in Britain. But as a fellow MP I do feel the need to express my joy and solidarity with British parliamentarians.”A former head of the EU council’s legal service, Jean-Claude Piris, tweeted: “It gives me good and emotional feelings too.“It was so sad to see this great country at the risk of being led to no longer respect the principles and values upon which its democratic institutions have been built over centuries.”But sources said it was also clear now that Johnson had little hope of presenting MPs with the choice of leaving, “do or die”, with or without a deal on 31 October.The prime minister is seemingly constrained by the Benn Act, which would instruct him to seek an extension if a deal is not agreed with the EU and backed by the Commons, but Johnson had suggested he would find a way around the law.The ruling has confirmed to Brussels that parliament is in the driving seat and able to instruct the prime minister as it wishes over the coming weeks, with an increased chance of a general election next month, and a reduced possibility of a deal being agreed and passed by the Commons next month.One EU diplomat said: “Another domestic in this long Brexit saga. Parliament hasn’t been able to formulate a position in the last three years so why would they suddenly now?“Without decisive action their government is driving this process off the cliff. But seeing as Brexit was about the sovereignty of parliament it was bewildering that government moved to suspend it. So much about this process is contradictory and utterly mind-blowing.”EU officials think the court ruling has increased the chances of an extension request from the UK. “Are the chances of an extension request probably very high? Yes,” said one source. “And has the court’s judgment made the chances higher? Cautiously yes. And is the EU banging its head against a brick wall saying: ‘When is this going to stop?’ Absolutely.”Fabian Zuleeg, the chief executive of the European Policy Centre thinktank, tweeted: “Conclusions? 31 October no deal unlikely unless Boris Johnson is willing to break law and won’t be stopped.“So Boris Johnson only has two real options: resign and fight election on clear no-deal stance or make deal, capitulating in negotiations. Former looks more likely but unlikely to bring resolution.”The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said the issue was an “internal matter” for the UK. “Whoever is prime minister of the United Kingdom is somebody we’re going to work with,” he said. “It’s not for us to decide who the prime minister of the UK is.”Asked whether the ruling would impact on the EU’s trust in Johnson, a European commission spokeswoman said: “We have all seen the news but it is not for us to comment on the internal constitutional matters of the United Kingdom. Our interlocutor is the United Kingdom government and that remains the case. All other judgments I leave to you.”","Supreme court ruling makes no-deal scenario less likely, EU believes",2019-09-24/16:05:05,the uk supreme court ruling against boris johnson was celebrated in eu capitals and has left brussels convinced that the prime minister has lost control of events and will not be able to crash britain out on  october as lady hale the president of the uk s highest court read out its unanimous judgment politicians officials and diplomats involved in the brexit talks spoke of their reassurance about the state of the rule of law in the uk the decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks in order to avoid parliamentary scrutiny had already provoked criticism by senior politicians in the european parliament and the court s confirmation on tuesday that johnson s move was unlawful was welcomed guy verhofstadt the eu parliament s brexit coordinator tweeted at least one big relief in the brexit saga the rule of law in the uk is alive kicking parliaments should never be silenced in a real democracy i never want to hear boris johnson or any other brexiteer say again that the european union is undemocratic the european parliament s speaker david sassoli said important decision from uk supreme court to rule prorogation of parliament as unlawful any brexit agreement needs to be approved by both uk and eu parliament so proper democratic scrutiny on both sides of the channel is essential the chair of the bundestag s foreign affairs committee norbert röttgen who is a senior member of angela merkel s cdu party expressed his satisfaction at the judgment he said it is not my place to comment on judicial proceedings in britain but as a fellow mp i do feel the need to express my joy and solidarity with british parliamentarians a former head of the eu council s legal service jean claude piris tweeted it gives me good and emotional feelings too it was so sad to see this great country at the risk of being led to no longer respect the principles and values upon which its democratic institutions have been built over centuries but sources said it was also clear now that johnson had little hope of presenting mps with the choice of leaving do or die with or without a deal on  october the prime minister is seemingly constrained by the benn act which would instruct him to seek an extension if a deal is not agreed with the eu and backed by the commons but johnson had suggested he would find a way around the law the ruling has confirmed to brussels that parliament is in the driving seat and able to instruct the prime minister as it wishes over the coming weeks with an increased chance of a general election next month and a reduced possibility of a deal being agreed and passed by the commons next month one eu diplomat said another domestic in this long brexit saga parliament hasn t been able to formulate a position in the last three years so why would they suddenly now without decisive action their government is driving this process off the cliff but seeing as brexit was about the sovereignty of parliament it was bewildering that government moved to suspend it so much about this process is contradictory and utterly mind blowing eu officials think the court ruling has increased the chances of an extension request from the uk are the chances of an extension request probably very high yes said one source and has the court s judgment made the chances higher cautiously yes and is the eu banging its head against a brick wall saying when is this going to stop absolutely fabian zuleeg the chief executive of the european policy centre thinktank tweeted conclusions  october no deal unlikely unless boris johnson is willing to break law and won t be stopped so boris johnson only has two real options resign and fight election on clear no deal stance or make deal capitulating in negotiations former looks more likely but unlikely to bring resolution the irish taoiseach leo varadkar said the issue was an internal matter for the uk whoever is prime minister of the united kingdom is somebody we re going to work with he said it s not for us to decide who the prime minister of the uk is asked whether the ruling would impact on the eu s trust in johnson a european commission spokeswoman said we have all seen the news but it is not for us to comment on the internal constitutional matters of the united kingdom our interlocutor is the united kingdom government and that remains the case all other judgments i leave to you ,Brexit,0.21296411752700806

You can also catch our latest Brexit Means … podcast here, and for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.Brexit is just over a month away and despite repeated claims by the government that progress is being made on changes to the withdrawal deal that might somehow make it acceptable to MPs, there’s still no evidence to suggest that’s actually the case.In a speech in Strasbourg the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, demanded operable proposals, in writing, from the UK on replacing the Irish backstop and warned a no-deal exit was now a “palpable risk”.Finland, which holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union, and France said whatever Britain did come up with would have to be tabled within a fortnight so it could be properly discussed by the EU27 before next month’s summit.But it emerged that Boris Johnson had been “taken aback” during his meeting with Juncker last week at the scale and complexity of the potential problems on the border, and the extent to which Britain’s sketchy ideas have failed to address them.In a speech in Madrid that went down like a lead balloon, Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay said the “purist” EU would have to “take risks” with the Irish border for a deal to be struck, demanding more flexibility and compromise from the bloc.The government said it would present its plans when it was ready, and then angered the EU27 by insisting that the papers it finally submitted – dismissed in Brussels as still “very far” from what was required – must not be circulated.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, later described the British solution for replacing the backstop as unacceptable, adding that the UK government’s position would have to change for there to be any hope of success.Meanwhile, the supreme court heard arguments in London for and against Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament until 14 October, including allegations that the mother of parliaments had been “shut down by the father of lies” and that the government’s stated reasons for the prorogation were misleading.No 10 said it could not rule out proroguing parliament again if it loses the potentially explosive case, while the judges were urged to encourage the speakers of the Commons and Lords to reconvene the parliamentary session. The verdict should come on Tuesday morning (see below).As the prime minister headed to a UN climate summit in New York, where he was due to meet European leaders saying he was “cautiously optimistic” he could negotiate a deal with EU leaders, Labour continued to tear itself to pieces over its Brexit policy.Jeremy Corbyn wanted to “stay neutral” and let the people decide in a referendum; activists pushed for a campaign to remain; the party conference was plunged into Brexit disarray and then into downright chaos.In the end, Corbyn won: delegates rejected a motion that would have obliged Labour to adopt an out-and-out remain position before a general election.In the short term, all eyes are on the supreme court, whose verdict on whether Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was lawful or not is expected on Tuesday morning.A ruling against the government could trigger a “constitutional eruption of volcanic proportions”, one legal expert said, with much depending on how the court framed such a decision – particularly if it determines that Johnson misled the Queen.Past that, the crucial problem facing the prime minister is whether or not he can solve the riddle of the Irish backstop and thus wring a deal from the EU (he would then have to get it through parliament, of course, but that’s for another day).At the moment the two sides have starkly different visions of what the withdrawal agreement and the Irish protocol need to guarantee.Britain has proposed Northern Ireland stays under EU rules for agri-food but that otherwise there be two regulatory zones on the island, with some checks on goods necessary albeit facilitated by technology. The EU wants to secure full frictionless trade across the island in order to maintain the status quo.At present, there is little sign of any meaningful rapprochement.UK regions most exposed to no-deal Brexit also most deprived, warns study.Health cover for retired Britons in EU to last six months in no-deal Brexit.No-deal Brexit will have “seismic” impact, says European car industry.English people living in Wales tilted it towards Brexit, research finds.Arlene Foster signals DUP shift on Northern Ireland border issue.Interest rate cut more likely due to Brexit uncertainty, says Bank.No-deal Brexit will cut 3% off UK economic growth, says OECD.Hard Brexit would put officers’ lives at risk, says Northern Ireland police chief.Importers stockpile alcohol for Christmas to avoid Brexit drought.Polish ambassador urges Poles to “seriously consider” leaving UK.In the Guardian, Jonathan Lis argues that the language of Brexit “betrayal” is poisoning politics:Our fundamental problem is we have lost the ability to distinguish between compromise and betrayal. We now confront a situation in which language proves as dangerous as policy.Politicians can no longer merely disagree. They must be acting in bad faith, or subverting democracy, or betraying the electorate. This finds its extreme form in the word “treason”, which now peppers and pollutes the language of rightwing politicians and commentators. But it has also insinuated itself into the way we address Brexit altogether.The essential toxin here is the requirement for political purity. This is partly driven by the increasing radicalism of our mainstream political parties and partly by the appetite for nationalism unleashed by the referendum and now rapidly advancing.Britain is no longer just riven politically and economically, but fully entrenched in a culture war which demands rigid and extreme conceptions of identity. This new polarisation necessitates an all-or-nothing stance not just on Brexit, but on politics altogether.

1218,"The Labour leader has set out a careful position on how he would like to deal with Brexit in a strategy aimed at not alienating either leave or remain voters at an election. He would first want to win an election, then negotiate a Labour Brexit deal with Brussels relatively quickly. Within six months of the election, there would be a second referendum to choose between Labour’s deal and remaining in the EU. A special conference would decide how Labour should campaign.Corbyn has so far refused to say whether he would prefer a Labour-led Brexit deal or to remain in the EU, saying it depends what is negotiated with Brussels. It is not clear whether he could stay above the fray of campaigning in a referendum while the party picked a side. His aim would probably be to play the honest broker carrying out what the people decide. It puts him in a different place from senior Labour figures who want to personally campaign to remain, including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the deputy leader, Tom Watson, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary.Many remain campaigners are unhappy with Corbyn’s stance and wanted an unequivocal policy of campaigning to stay in the EU going into an election. MPs in marginal seats, including shadow cabinet ministers, are also concerned the Lib Dems, who have a policy of revoking article 50, could take a significant amount of votes off them at an election without a more pro-remain stance.Corbyn’s position won by a show of hands, with the chair not seeing the need for a vote to be counted precisely – known as a “card vote”. A succession of speakers from Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, to Momentum activists succeeded in turning the issue into one of loyalty to Corbyn’s leadership. But the row caused bitter splits among Labour groups and trade unions, with Unison and a big chunk of local parties having declared remain positions. While Corbyn did appear to have the backing of the room, remain campaigners said that could have been because of his support from the unions. “It is possible that the remain motion had a majority in the CLPs, but because there was no card vote we will never know,” said one.Corbyn’s position within the party has been once again bolstered, as it became clear he had the backing of the floor. However, it was a battle partly won because of a trade union bloc vote by Unite and the GMB in his favour and much of the membership are still hoping for a shift to a pro-remain position in future. There will still likely be a battle at the party’s clause V meeting ahead of an election to decide the manifesto position. However, Corbyn’s victory makes it much more likely that Labour will head to the polls without saying whether it would campaign to leave or remain in the event of a second referendum.The EU has always said it is ready to work with any British government to map out a future relationship, ranging from Norway-style membership of the single market to a Canada-style free trade agreement putting much greater distance between the bloc and the UK.What has been ruled out repeatedly are substantial changes to the divorce deal: the legally binding withdrawal agreement covering citizens’ rights, the Brexit bill and the Irish border. A revamped political declaration could be agreed within days, if the UK wanted it. However, it would only be a prelude to years of post-Brexit negotiations on trade, security and foreign policy.While the EU would welcome a closer trading relationship, which is less damaging for economies on both sides, it has ruled out granting the UK special status. The EU has repeatedly said non-membership can never be as good as membership. That guiding principle makes some ideas circulated by Labour MPs implausible, such as a British veto on EU trade deals, or a British opt-out from free movement of people, while having unrestricted free movement of goods, services and capital.",What does Labour vote signify about where it stands on Brexit?,2019-09-23/20:04:47,the labour leader has set out a careful position on how he would like to deal with brexit in a strategy aimed at not alienating either leave or remain voters at an election he would first want to win an election then negotiate a labour brexit deal with brussels relatively quickly within six months of the election there would be a second referendum to choose between labour s deal and remaining in the eu a special conference would decide how labour should campaign corbyn has so far refused to say whether he would prefer a labour led brexit deal or to remain in the eu saying it depends what is negotiated with brussels it is not clear whether he could stay above the fray of campaigning in a referendum while the party picked a side his aim would probably be to play the honest broker carrying out what the people decide it puts him in a different place from senior labour figures who want to personally campaign to remain including the shadow chancellor john mcdonnell the deputy leader tom watson and emily thornberry the shadow foreign secretary many remain campaigners are unhappy with corbyn s stance and wanted an unequivocal policy of campaigning to stay in the eu going into an election mps in marginal seats including shadow cabinet ministers are also concerned the lib dems who have a policy of revoking article  could take a significant amount of votes off them at an election without a more pro remain stance corbyn s position won by a show of hands with the chair not seeing the need for a vote to be counted precisely known as a card vote a succession of speakers from len mccluskey the unite general secretary to momentum activists succeeded in turning the issue into one of loyalty to corbyn s leadership but the row caused bitter splits among labour groups and trade unions with unison and a big chunk of local parties having declared remain positions while corbyn did appear to have the backing of the room remain campaigners said that could have been because of his support from the unions it is possible that the remain motion had a majority in the clps but because there was no card vote we will never know said one corbyn s position within the party has been once again bolstered as it became clear he had the backing of the floor however it was a battle partly won because of a trade union bloc vote by unite and the gmb in his favour and much of the membership are still hoping for a shift to a pro remain position in future there will still likely be a battle at the party s clause v meeting ahead of an election to decide the manifesto position however corbyn s victory makes it much more likely that labour will head to the polls without saying whether it would campaign to leave or remain in the event of a second referendum the eu has always said it is ready to work with any british government to map out a future relationship ranging from norway style membership of the single market to a canada style free trade agreement putting much greater distance between the bloc and the uk what has been ruled out repeatedly are substantial changes to the divorce deal the legally binding withdrawal agreement covering citizens rights the brexit bill and the irish border a revamped political declaration could be agreed within days if the uk wanted it however it would only be a prelude to years of post brexit negotiations on trade security and foreign policy while the eu would welcome a closer trading relationship which is less damaging for economies on both sides it has ruled out granting the uk special status the eu has repeatedly said non membership can never be as good as membership that guiding principle makes some ideas circulated by labour mps implausible such as a british veto on eu trade deals or a british opt out from free movement of people while having unrestricted free movement of goods services and capital ,Brexit,0.2754802703857422
1272,"The question of why Wales voted to leave the EU can in large part be answered by the number of English retired people who have moved across the border, research has found.Despite being one of the biggest beneficiaries of EU funding, Wales voted leave by a majority of 52% to 48% in the 2016 referendum – a result that took some analysts by surprise. However, work by Danny Dorling, a professor of geography at Oxford, found that the  result could in part be attributed to the influence of English voters.“If you look at the more genuinely Welsh areas, especially the Welsh-speaking ones, they did not want to leave the EU,” Dorling told the Sunday Times. “Wales was made to look like a Brexit-supporting nation by its English settlers.”About 21% (650,000) of people living in Wales were born in England, with nearly a quarter aged over 65. The country voted for Brexit by a majority of just 82,000.Border towns and areas of central Wales with large English communities, such as Wrexham and Powys, recorded a higher proportion of leave votes, whereas Welsh-speaking areas such as Gwynedd and Ceredigion had high remain votes.Dorling’s research, which was presented at the British Science Association’s annual meeting at Warwick University, also suggested that most of the UK’s leave votes did come not from the north of England but the south, with the highest numbers in areas populated with affluent older people, such as Hampshire, Cornwall and Devon.“The Welsh did not want to quit the EU, but that is one of many false beliefs about Brexit. The biggest is that the pro-leave vote was due to northerners,” he said. “It’s true some northern areas were strongly pro-Brexit, but the population there is too small to swing the vote.“The real support for Brexit, in terms of numbers of votes, was in places like Cornwall, which was 57% for leave, Hampshire with 54%, Essex with 62% and Norfolk with 57%. It is those southern English voters that are dragging Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland unwillingly out of Europe.“Everyone blames Wigan and Stoke for Brexit but we should really be blaming Cornwall and Devon.”","English people living in Wales tilted it towards Brexit, research finds",2019-09-22/15:59:34,the question of why wales voted to leave the eu can in large part be answered by the number of english retired people who have moved across the border research has found despite being one of the biggest beneficiaries of eu funding wales voted leave by a majority of  to  in the  referendum a result that took some analysts by surprise however work by danny dorling a professor of geography at oxford found that the result could in part be attributed to the influence of english voters if you look at the more genuinely welsh areas especially the welsh speaking ones they did not want to leave the eu dorling told the sunday times wales was made to look like a brexit supporting nation by its english settlers about    of people living in wales were born in england with nearly a quarter aged over  the country voted for brexit by a majority of just   border towns and areas of central wales with large english communities such as wrexham and powys recorded a higher proportion of leave votes whereas welsh speaking areas such as gwynedd and ceredigion had high remain votes dorling s research which was presented at the british science association s annual meeting at warwick university also suggested that most of the uk s leave votes did come not from the north of england but the south with the highest numbers in areas populated with affluent older people such as hampshire cornwall and devon the welsh did not want to quit the eu but that is one of many false beliefs about brexit the biggest is that the pro leave vote was due to northerners he said it s true some northern areas were strongly pro brexit but the population there is too small to swing the vote the real support for brexit in terms of numbers of votes was in places like cornwall which was  for leave hampshire with  essex with  and norfolk with  it is those southern english voters that are dragging scotland wales and northern ireland unwillingly out of europe everyone blames wigan and stoke for brexit but we should really be blaming cornwall and devon ,Brexit,0.20053118467330933
1682,"The chances of the UK staying in the EU are as high as 30% as the country would be likely to reject Brexit in a second referendum, the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, has said.The bloc’s most senior official claimed the British public had only truly debated Brexit after the 2016 referendum and there was significant reason to believe the leave vote could be reversed.Describing the decision by the former British prime minister, David Cameron, to call the vote as a political miscalculation, Tusk said he would expect a different result in a vote today given what had been learned about the consequences of leaving.“The referendum was at the worst possible moment, it is the result of a wrong political calculation,” Tusk said in an interview with the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza (GW) that was shared with the Guardian as part of the Europa collaboration of six European newspapers.“A real debate about the consequences of Brexit wasn’t had during the referendum campaign, but only after the vote. Today the result would probably look different. Paradoxically, Brexit awoke in Great Britain a pro-European movement.”Tusk, whose tenure as president of the European council, the EU body made up of the 28 leaders of member states, is due to end in November, said he had been moved by the anti-Brexit march in London earlier this year during which he was celebrated as a voice calling for the UK to reconsider.While suggesting there was a “crisis in leadership” among remainers, in an echo of his previous claim that the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn is essentially pro-Brexit, Tusk said he still believed it was possible the question could again be put to the people.The Labour leader this week suggested a second referendum could be a “healing” development, as cross-party talks over the Brexit impasse in Westminster appeared to be fizzling out.“Hannah Arendt said that in politics and history things only become irreversible when people recognise them as such. Because, in themselves, they are not irreversible,” Tusk said.“After the British referendum in 2016, I thought that if we recognise that the case is closed, it will be the end. Today the chance that Brexit will not happen is, in my opinion, 20-30%. That’s a lot.“From month to month, it is becoming increasingly clear that the UK’s exit from the EU will look completely different than the Brexit that was promoted,” Tusk added. “I see no reason to capitulate.”The former Polish prime minister, who was interviewed by the GW editor, Adam Michnik, to mark the newspaper’s 30th anniversary, said there was historical precedent for the British people revisiting decisions made in referendums.“Even if we repeat that the referendum is the expression of will by the nation, and the will of the nation must be respected, yes, you have to respect it,” he said. “But the 2016 referendum was not the first on the UK‘s membership of the EU. The first took place in 1975, when the British, two years after entering the European Economic Commmunity, decided whether to remain in it.“If the 2016 referendum was able to change the result of the referendum in 1975, why can it not be changed again? Nothing is irreversible until people believe it is.”In April, Britain’s membership of the EU was extended to 31 October by the 27 heads of state and government to allow Downing Street more time to secure ratification of the withdrawal agreement.The UK had been due to leave the bloc on 29 March, after two years of negotiations, but the repeated rejection of Theresa May’s Brexit deal by the Commons forced the prime minister to seek more time.Tusk admitted that “almost every day” he heard from those who said the UK should be cut off from the EU if it was unable to come to a deal.“My main task is to make sure that the EU has shown patience despite being felt in many places on the continent these negative emotions,” he said. “I say to colleagues to wait a while longer. For now, we managed to win some time. The deadline expires in October, but I will persuade them – if necessary – not to close the calendar. There is no place for rush to Brexit. Churchill used to say that a problem postponed is partially solved.”",Donald Tusk: chance of Brexit being cancelled could be 30%,2019-05-10/11:00:29,the chances of the uk staying in the eu are as high as  as the country would be likely to reject brexit in a second referendum the president of the european council donald tusk has said the bloc s most senior official claimed the british public had only truly debated brexit after the  referendum and there was significant reason to believe the leave vote could be reversed describing the decision by the former british prime minister david cameron to call the vote as a political miscalculation tusk said he would expect a different result in a vote today given what had been learned about the consequences of leaving the referendum was at the worst possible moment it is the result of a wrong political calculation tusk said in an interview with the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza gw that was shared with the guardian as part of the europa collaboration of six european newspapers a real debate about the consequences of brexit wasn t had during the referendum campaign but only after the vote today the result would probably look different paradoxically brexit awoke in great britain a pro european movement tusk whose tenure as president of the european council the eu body made up of the  leaders of member states is due to end in november said he had been moved by the anti brexit march in london earlier this year during which he was celebrated as a voice calling for the uk to reconsider while suggesting there was a crisis in leadership among remainers in an echo of his previous claim that the labour party under jeremy corbyn is essentially pro brexit tusk said he still believed it was possible the question could again be put to the people the labour leader this week suggested a second referendum could be a healing development as cross party talks over the brexit impasse in westminster appeared to be fizzling out hannah arendt said that in politics and history things only become irreversible when people recognise them as such because in themselves they are not irreversible tusk said after the british referendum in  i thought that if we recognise that the case is closed it will be the end today the chance that brexit will not happen is in my opinion   that s a lot from month to month it is becoming increasingly clear that the uk s exit from the eu will look completely different than the brexit that was promoted tusk added i see no reason to capitulate the former polish prime minister who was interviewed by the gw editor adam michnik to mark the newspaper s th anniversary said there was historical precedent for the british people revisiting decisions made in referendums even if we repeat that the referendum is the expression of will by the nation and the will of the nation must be respected yes you have to respect it he said but the  referendum was not the first on the uk s membership of the eu the first took place in  when the british two years after entering the european economic commmunity decided whether to remain in it if the  referendum was able to change the result of the referendum in  why can it not be changed again nothing is irreversible until people believe it is in april britain s membership of the eu was extended to  october by the  heads of state and government to allow downing street more time to secure ratification of the withdrawal agreement the uk had been due to leave the bloc on  march after two years of negotiations but the repeated rejection of theresa may s brexit deal by the commons forced the prime minister to seek more time tusk admitted that almost every day he heard from those who said the uk should be cut off from the eu if it was unable to come to a deal my main task is to make sure that the eu has shown patience despite being felt in many places on the continent these negative emotions he said i say to colleagues to wait a while longer for now we managed to win some time the deadline expires in october but i will persuade them if necessary not to close the calendar there is no place for rush to brexit churchill used to say that a problem postponed is partially solved ,Brexit,0.31796640157699585
1977,"The government has given British Steel an emergency £120m loan to cover an EU bill for carbon dioxide emissions, after the delay in reaching a Brexit withdrawal deal forced it to intervene.The business secretary, Greg Clark, told parliament that British Steel would have faced a bill of more than £600m from EU regulators if the government had not given it the support.British Steel has been unable to obtain its free carbon emissions credits for this year under the EU’s Emissions Trading System, after the European Commission suspended the UK from the scheme in December in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit.While the UK’s membership of the EU has been extended until October, parliament’s inability to vote through a withdrawal agreement has meant that British companies, including British Steel, are still locked out of the system.British Steel faced a fine of £500m from the European commission, on top of the £120m cost of buying the allowances, which polluting industries must have if they continue to emit greenhouse gases.The company, which has an annual turnover of £1.4bn, approached the government earlier this year, saying it was unable to pay for enough allowances before the deadline of midnight on Tuesday. Clark said a liability of that size would have put the company under “significant financial strain”.The government expects to recoup all of the money loaned to British Steel plus interest by taking over British Steel’s allowances and selling them on. British Steel has committed to cover the difference if the price of allowances falls by the time it eventually receives them.The scramble to pay the carbon bill underlines the struggles faced by the UK steel industry in recent years. British Steel, which currently employs 4,200 people directly in the UK, in Scunthorpe, Skinningrove and Redcar, was bought for £1 from India’s Tata Steel by investment firm Greybull Capital in June 2016. However, in September it cut the jobs of a tenth of its employees, blaming a weak pound.Anna Turley, the Labour MP for Redcar, welcomed the announcement, but tweeted that the announcement showed that the government could have intervened when the company was struggling in 2015.Steve Turner, assistant general secretary for manufacturing at Unite, the union, said the company’s workers “will be breathing a sigh of relief”. However, he warned that the relief “could be short lived” without wider support for the steel industry.The union has argued that the government should mandate the use of British steel in UK warships, as well as giving support on energy costs.",British Steel receives £120m government loan,2019-05-01/17:14:22,the government has given british steel an emergency m loan to cover an eu bill for carbon dioxide emissions after the delay in reaching a brexit withdrawal deal forced it to intervene the business secretary greg clark told parliament that british steel would have faced a bill of more than m from eu regulators if the government had not given it the support british steel has been unable to obtain its free carbon emissions credits for this year under the eu s emissions trading system after the european commission suspended the uk from the scheme in december in preparation for a possible no deal brexit while the uk s membership of the eu has been extended until october parliament s inability to vote through a withdrawal agreement has meant that british companies including british steel are still locked out of the system british steel faced a fine of m from the european commission on top of the m cost of buying the allowances which polluting industries must have if they continue to emit greenhouse gases the company which has an annual turnover of  bn approached the government earlier this year saying it was unable to pay for enough allowances before the deadline of midnight on tuesday clark said a liability of that size would have put the company under significant financial strain the government expects to recoup all of the money loaned to british steel plus interest by taking over british steel s allowances and selling them on british steel has committed to cover the difference if the price of allowances falls by the time it eventually receives them the scramble to pay the carbon bill underlines the struggles faced by the uk steel industry in recent years british steel which currently employs   people directly in the uk in scunthorpe skinningrove and redcar was bought for  from india s tata steel by investment firm greybull capital in june  however in september it cut the jobs of a tenth of its employees blaming a weak pound anna turley the labour mp for redcar welcomed the announcement but tweeted that the announcement showed that the government could have intervened when the company was struggling in  steve turner assistant general secretary for manufacturing at unite the union said the company s workers will be breathing a sigh of relief however he warned that the relief could be short lived without wider support for the steel industry the union has argued that the government should mandate the use of british steel in uk warships as well as giving support on energy costs ,Brexit,0.18608970940113068
2055,"Welcome back to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing: trying to make sense of the nonsensical since June 2016. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And you can catch our monthly Brexit Means podcast here.Well. It’s all – somewhat, I suspect, to everyone’s relief – gone terribly quiet. Almost as if the accumulated exhaustion, a welcome Easter break and that lengthy article 50 extension until 31 October have combined to take the wind out of Brexit’s sails.It would be a mistake, though, to think it’s gone away. It really hasn’t. So Brexit talks between government ministers and Labour to find a compromise able to win MPs’ backing resumed last week, but expectations of a breakthrough were minimal.Rumours that Theresa May – who still hopes a deal will be ratified in time to avoid the UK taking part in EU elections next month – would table a vote on the key legislation enacting Britain’s exit from the EU as early as next week proved unfounded.Labour complained the government would not contemplate substantive changes to the deal’s political declaration (on Britain’s future relationship with the EU), instead proposing greater assurances on environmental standards and workers’ rights in a redrafted withdrawal act implementation bill.And amid a growing sense of political paralysis in Westminster, the prime minister suffered a further blow to her authority as backbench Tory MPs, while stopping short of changing the party’s rules to allow her to be ousted within weeks, demanded a “roadmap” for her departure whether her deal passes or not.Away from the Conservatives, the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage – whose new Brexit party leads the polling for the European elections – said he aimed to build on the momentum of the 26 May vote to get rid of what he termed a “remain parliament”.Meanwhile, Labour faced a Brexit crisis of its own after a campaign leaflet in the south-west of England sparked fury among the party’s remainer beckbenchers and members by failing to mention a second referendum, which they say is now official party policy.Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would decide this week what to put in its election manifesto, while the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, reckoned it could sign up to a Brexit deal without a second vote if the talks made progress soon.The Labour MPs behind parliament’s push for a confirmatory referendum wrote to their party’s governing body demanding it use the elections to campaign for a fresh poll regardless of whether a deal has been reached with the government.It’s anyone’s guess. May survived the backbench attempt to call a second no confidence vote, but few believe she can dodge having to fight the EU elections – with the prospect of going up against Farage’s Brexit party infuriating Tory MPs.There is acknowledgement the government must, however, attempt something new before the elections, and if the cross-party talks fail to advance it may try to devise a way to forge a compromise through a small number of new indicative votes.May could be challenged, including by cabinet ministers, if she agrees to a closer customs arrangement as a way of getting Labour to back her deal. And if, as expected, the Tories are humiliated in local elections and then overwhelmed by the Brexit party in the European vote, she could yet decide to go of her own accord.Brexit has trapped UK in no man’s land, warns top economistBrexit will slow UK economy for rest of 2019, forecaster warnsTories should expect to lose 800 seats in local elections, says analystEU students could face higher fees to study in UK from 2020Kezia Dugdale to leave politics over Labour’s Brexit stancePublic thinks EU referendum was bad idea, says pollUK parties unveil eye-catching European election candidatesLib Dems launch EU election campaign with “Stop Brexit” messageP&O sues over £33m Eurotunnel payout in Brexit ferry fiascoIrish backstop could undermine EU standards, German report saysSecretive hard-Brexit Facebook campaign got 1m responsesUK’s biggest fishing trawler sails up Thames in Brexit warningThe Guardian’s editorial on the state of the Conservative party pulled no punches, saying it was being destroyed by Brexit:Many ministers seem to have returned to Westminster this week blinded by the ambition to succeed Theresa May. Much of the Tory party returned with only one idea – a leadership challenge which would solve nothing whatsoever about Brexit and could easily trigger a general election in which the Tories could be massacred. It is said that those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad. This seems to be true of the modern Conservative party. Driven crazy by the failure of Brexit and obsessed with the stupid fantasy that a more doctrinaire leader than Mrs May would be more successful than she is, much of the party today displays all the dignity and judgment of a headless chicken. The Tory party used to pride itself on being the natural party of government. Today it is proving itself unfit for government at all.Matthew d’Ancona reckoned Nigel Farage was – as he had long predicted – being fuelled by the myth of Brexit betrayal, enabling a new movement to rise up amid the anger:The political class has strained every tendon to find a way of delivering the undeliverable: extracting the UK from a 46-year relationship without wrecking its prosperity, security and access to the wider world. Brexit has failed because that square-circling task is impossible. But Farage appeals to a primal social instinct: that the few are, yet again, cheating the many of their dream. It is not the dream that is at fault, you understand, but those who sabotage it. Just as Marxists insist true communism has never been tried, so Brexiteers declare that their simple plan has been wrecked by weaklings, quislings and fools. Brexit was designed by its most passionate supporters to fail: its purpose was to be betrayed, to enable a new movement to rise up, animated by fury and fear. Such a movement has now been born. It is already tearing the Conservative party to pieces. That, sad to say, is only the beginning of its plan.A somewhat despairing plea from one of the Tory party’s most committed Brexiters:Please don't let Brexit put you off voting Conservative in the

2473,"The possibility of the UK leaving the European Union blared like an air-raid siren in Government Buildings, the quadrangle of Portland stone and Wicklow granite in central Dublin that houses the taoiseach’s office. Officials summoned politicians, diplomats, business leaders, farming groups, academics and others to the complex off Upper Merrion Street. The guests climbed a beechwood staircase with a stained glass window, My Four Green Fields, representing Ireland’s four provinces.At the improvised summit all agreed that Britain’s exit from the EU would present an unprecedented threat to Irish interests. They agreed to meet monthly to brainstorm – discussions which led to a task force, a strategy, a plan.This was 2015. Few people had even heard of the word Brexit. It was a year before David Cameron called the referendum, two years before Theresa May declared “red lines” over the UK’s withdrawal. It was three years before she agreed to the Irish border backstop as an option and signed the withdrawal agreement that triggered a breakdown in Westminster.The roots of the UK’s political and constitutional crisis spread far and wide: decades of anti-EU propaganda, a Tory party civil war, a reckless Cameron gamble, a dogged, blinkered successor, a divided Labour party. And with a starring role, the backstop.A term once confined to rounders and baseball, it refers to an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the event of the UK’s no-deal departure. The Irish government persuaded the EU to make the backstop a condition of the UK’s withdrawal.Supporters, including Tony Blair and John Major, say it is needed to protect the 1998 Good Friday agreement which drew a line under the Troubles and ended a three-decade conflict that claimed more than 3,600 lives. They say the return of border controls and infrastructure could wreck the peace process.Brexiters call the backstop a trap which could chain the UK to Brussels in a de facto customs union and undermine the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Both sides agree that Dublin outplayed its former colonial master. While London dithered in the referendum aftermath, the Irish nimbly forged an alliance of all 27 member states.“I pay tribute to the Irish government and Ireland the way that ... you know ... people in Dublin really saw the issues a long way out, much more clearly, perhaps than people in London did,” a rueful Boris Johnson, the former British foreign secretary, admitted in January during a visit to Dublin.The story of the backstop is not of a flawlessly executed Celtic masterplan, however. Dublin conceived it fitfully and gradually in response to British contradictions and missteps. But once crystallised as a goal, the Irish pursued it hell for leather.“It was very clearly identified at the very early stages that Northern Ireland and the border would become an issue,” Helen McEntee, Ireland’s minister of state for European affairs, said in an interview this week.“The border came up at every meeting,” said Andrew Gilmore, deputy research director at the Institute of International and European Affairs thinktank, who attended stakeholder consultations.While the UK suffered from what some call “Brexit comprehension lag” the Irish were quick off the blocks.Enda Kenny, the then taoiseach, ordered the first Brexit impact study in 2014. Officials identified the impact on the economy, diplomatic ties, and crucially the Good Friday agreement and what Brexit would mean for the border. A further 85-page report was produced in November 2015 outlining consequences of a yes and a no vote.2014: The first Brexit impact report identifies the border as an issue for the Good Friday agreement and single market. This leads to a second report in 2015 detailing options for Ireland if the UK votes to leave the EU.24 June 2016: The day after the EU referendum, Dublin activates contingency plans to create a Brexit taskforce and ramps up diplomatic missions across the bloc.17 January 2017: Theresa May’s Lancaster House declaration of 'red lines' convinces Dublin of the need for a border insurance policy.29 April 2017: Dublin persuades the European commission to make the border a priority in guidelines for the first phase of the negotiations. It confirms the EU’s 'Ireland-first' policy.4 December 2017: May is poised to sign up to 'regulatory alignment' between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, which would avert a hard border. But the Democratic Unionist party intervenes, saying it would weaken Northern Ireland’s place in the UK. May extends the backstop to the whole of the UK, angering Brexiters.It went into detail that barely troubled the leave campaign, including options for membership of the EEA, a customs union, bilateral trade agreements and the doomsday option of a no-deal exit, in which the UK and EU would default to World Trade Organization rules.After the shock of the no vote sunk in, Kenny quickly assembled a team of almost 100 people to work on Brexit. He beefed up embassies across EU capitals to convey a stark message: the border was not just about protecting the single market, it was about peace.Irish policymakers knew referendums could turn into opportunities for voters to kick the political establishment – it happened in Ireland numerous times. To neutralise the danger Kenny lobbied the EU to grant Cameron meaningful concessions in talks in early 2016 to help him win the referendum. He also warned Cameron to be extremely careful.All in vain. The EU concessions to Cameron were meagre and he bungled the campaign.“It’s often difficult to get information out to people, to make it clear what it is that you’re asking of them. So there was always a concern that it might not be as straightforward as people thought,” said McEntee, speaking from an office adorned with Irish and EU flags.Despite their forebodings, the referendum result shocked Irish officials. They had hoped to shelve the contingency plans. Instead they scrambled to develop them.“Those documents started as a basis and have evolved and grown legs and wings and developed into what we have now in terms of our strategy,” said McEntee.The Irish initially hoped bilateral talks could find a way to keep the border frictionless. The Good Friday agreement had fostered close ties with London. British officials often admired Government Buildings, an Edwardian gem designed by Sir Aston Webb, who also designed Buckingham Palace.But investigation of technical solutions, such as cameras or trusted traders, proved fruitless. In October 2016 Theresa May, who had replaced Cameron as prime minister, told the Tory party conference the UK would leave the single market, the first of her red lines.As she was speaking to appease the right wing of the party and neuter Ukip support in the country, the Irish government was growing increasingly worried about the border.In October Kenny agreed with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, that technical talks between officials in Brussels and Dublin would open. They met again in January 2017 and agreed “there was no technical solution” to the border.They were beginning to realise that only a political solution – specifically, regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the EU – could avert a hard border. This was the genesis of the backstop.That conviction grew when May gave her Lancaster House speech later in January, hardening her red lines, promising the UK would leave the customs union and the single market. Brexit did not mean Brexit; it meant hard Brexit.In Brussels and Dublin it was decided that the UK now “had to own” the border issue.All they had extracted out of Britain so far was a line in May’s speech that there would be “no return to the borders of the past”.“That was no good to us,” said one source. “That referenced watchtowers and guns, but this is not what the border issue was about, we were never going back there. This was about the customs union and the single market.”The turning point came a few months later in a keynote speech by Kenny, who for the first time indicated the bilateral approach was dead and avoiding a post-Brexit “hard border” was now vital for the republic’s national interest.It was a shift in Ireland’s position, born out of the investigations into the border technical issues conducted with the commission over the previous five months.The Irish goal was to get the border into a legally binding withdrawal agreement – Dublin’s point of maximum leverage – rather than future trade relations, when Dublin would struggle to be heard.Rumours that Ireland was angling for a legally binding solution spooked the then Brexit secretary, David Davis. A scheduled meeting with Ireland’s deputy prime minister was mysteriously cancelled. “When they heard what was potentially to be discussed, he suddenly wasn’t available,” said a source. “The relationship with David Davis was not good.”The Irish discounted Downing Street promises to keep the border as frictionless as possible, viewing the British as “slippery”, saying the right things but not necessarily delivering, said a source close to the talks. “They had decades of experience of negotiations with the British over Northern Ireland and knew what they would be like.”Ireland was a midget with a big advantage: British ineptitude. Downing Street failed to plan for Brexit before the referendum and never caught up. Conservative party divisions split the cabinet and sabotaged attempts to clarify goals and strategy.May compounded her difficulties by calling an election in June 2017 that lost her parliamentary majority and made her dependent on the Democratic Unionist party (DUP). The DUP opposed any special status for Northern Ireland lest it weaken the union. The prime minister tried to appease the DUP by widening the backstop to encompass the UK, not just Northern Ireland, but this angered Brexiters.Downing Street’s road to perdition began with three incompatible commitments: leaving the single market and customs union, the UK jumping together, and no hard border in Ireland. Logic said you could have two, not three.Brexiters squared this by saying any backstop would be a “convenient fiction” and not really legally binding. “Cakeism” – wanting to have your cake and eat it – entered the political lexicon. Ivan Rogers, the UK’s ambassador to Brussels, resigned in despair at “fantasies and delusions”.After Leo Varadkar succeeded Kenny in June 2017 the Irish pressed their advantage. The new taoiseach wanted a “win”, said one Fine Gael party colleague, and squeezing the Brits proved popular. A government colleague said Varadkar, a policy wonk with a direct style, was simply pursuing the national interest. “He’s Mr Spock. He looks at what’s logical and tries to operate on that basis.”Unlike May, besieged on all fronts, Varadkar enjoyed support from opposition parties and media commentators, who treated Brexit as a national emergency.The taoiseach relied on seasoned diplomats – Rory Montgomery, Declan Kelleher, John Callinan – and a tightknit cabinet team. McEntee operated from his office. Simon Coveney, his deputy and foreign minister, operated from Iveagh House, a 10-minute walk across St Stephen’s Green. Phil Hogan, Ireland’s EU commissioner, provided intelligence from Brussels.Britain assumed EU players would override Ireland. Surely German car makers and French farmers would not let fussing about a drizzly border between Derry and Dundalk imperil an orderly UK exit? But Berlin and Paris rebuffed Downing Street.Solidarity belonged to the member staying in the club, not the one leaving. Some had a personal stake in the backstop. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, used to be a commissioner who ran peace programmes in Northern Ireland. Baltic states with an eye on Russia appreciated the bloc supporting a minnow against a heavyweight.Some EU members needed wooing. “There was a feeling that people in Europe had forgotten about Northern Ireland … we needed to re-educate them,” said a source.Varadkar cited an Irish Times article about a 1972 IRA attack on a customs post. Ministers racked up air miles courting support and invited counterparts to visit the border.The Irish government had a semi-permanent base camp at the Carrickdale hotel near the old border customs post at Jonesborough on the road between Dublin and Belfast. It hosted a revolving cast of officials, foreign affairs ministers and premiers including Xavier Bettel, Michel Barnier, and Donald Tusk.It was vital to show that the border was an invisible line across fields and communities, said McEntee. “People see that and they understand how complex it is.” When former police officers brief them about the Troubles “it becomes much more real”, she said.And so unfolded a historic reversal.After the Anglo-Irish war in 1921 Dublin’s envoys bowed to British pressure and agreed to partition, creating a 310-mile border. Ireland’s ensuing civil war claimed the life of its chief negotiator, Michael Collins, but David Lloyd George claimed to have solved the Irish question.Almost a century later, another British premier is tangled in a deal involving that same border. It has sundered her party and parliament. Her pleas to reopen the agreement have failed.It is a great feat for Irish diplomacy. But Dublin is not celebrating. Unless the UK ratifies the withdrawal deal or cancels Brexit it may yet crash out of the EU with no deal, wreaking havoc on both sides of the Irish border and rendering the backstop a hollow victory. The Irish pay history some heed. They do not claim to have solved the British question.• Tomorrow: Daniel Boffey on how Brussels outmanoeuvred the UK• The caption to the picture of Leo Varadkar and Michel Barnier was amended on 18 April 2019 because an earlier version said Varadkhar was on the left.

plan this was  few people had even heard of the word brexit it was a year before david cameron called the referendum two years before theresa may declared red lines over the uk s withdrawal it was three years before she agreed to the irish border backstop as an option and signed the withdrawal agreement that triggered a breakdown in westminster the roots of the uk s political and constitutional crisis spread far and wide decades of anti eu propaganda a tory party civil war a reckless cameron gamble a dogged blinkered successor a divided labour party and with a starring role the backstop a term once confined to rounders and baseball it refers to an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland in the event of the uk s no deal departure the irish government persuaded the eu to make the backstop a condition of the uk s withdrawal supporters including tony blair and john major say it is needed to protect the  good friday agreement which drew a line under the troubles and ended a three decade conflict that claimed more than   lives they say the return of border controls and infrastructure could wreck the peace process brexiters call the backstop a trap which could chain the uk to brussels in a de facto customs union and undermine the union between great britain and northern ireland both sides agree that dublin outplayed its former colonial master while london dithered in the referendum aftermath the irish nimbly forged an alliance of all  member states i pay tribute to the irish government and ireland the way that you know people in dublin really saw the issues a long way out much more clearly perhaps than people in london did a rueful boris johnson the former british foreign secretary admitted in january during a visit to dublin the story of the backstop is not of a flawlessly executed celtic masterplan however dublin conceived it fitfully and gradually in response to british contradictions and missteps but once crystallised as a goal the irish pursued it hell for leather it was very clearly identified at the very early stages that northern ireland and the border would become an issue helen mcentee ireland s minister of state for european affairs said in an interview this week the border came up at every meeting said andrew gilmore deputy research director at the institute of international and european affairs thinktank who attended stakeholder consultations while the uk suffered from what some call brexit comprehension lag the irish were quick off the blocks enda kenny the then taoiseach ordered the first brexit impact study in  officials identified the impact on the economy diplomatic ties and crucially the good friday agreement and what brexit would mean for the border a further  page report was produced in november  outlining consequences of a yes and a no vote  the first brexit impact report identifies the border as an issue for the good friday agreement and single market this leads to a second report in  detailing options for ireland if the uk votes to leave the eu  june  the day after the eu referendum dublin activates contingency plans to create a brexit taskforce and ramps up diplomatic missions across the bloc  january  theresa may s lancaster house declaration of red lines convinces dublin of the need for a border insurance policy  april  dublin persuades the european commission to make the border a priority in guidelines for the first phase of the negotiations it confirms the eu s ireland first policy  december  may is poised to sign up to regulatory alignment between northern ireland and the irish republic which would avert a hard border but the democratic unionist party intervenes saying it would weaken northern ireland s place in the uk may extends the backstop to the whole of the uk angering brexiters it went into detail that barely troubled the leave campaign including options for membership of the eea a customs union bilateral trade agreements and the doomsday option of a no deal exit in which the uk and eu would default to world trade organization rules after the shock of the no vote sunk in kenny quickly assembled a team of almost  people to work on brexit he beefed up embassies across eu capitals to convey a stark message the border was not just about protecting the single market it was about peace irish policymakers knew referendums could turn into opportunities for voters to kick the political establishment it happened in ireland numerous times to neutralise the danger kenny lobbied the eu to grant cameron meaningful concessions in talks in early  to help him win the referendum he also warned cameron to be extremely careful all in vain the eu concessions to cameron were meagre and he bungled the campaign it s often difficult to get information out to people to make it clear what it is that you re asking of them so there was always a concern that it might not be as straightforward as people thought said mcentee speaking from an office adorned with irish and eu flags despite their forebodings the referendum result shocked irish officials they had hoped to shelve the contingency plans instead they scrambled to develop them those documents started as a basis and have evolved and grown legs and wings and developed into what we have now in terms of our strategy said mcentee the irish initially hoped bilateral talks could find a way to keep the border frictionless the good friday agreement had fostered close ties with london british officials often admired government buildings an edwardian gem designed by sir aston webb who also designed buckingham palace but investigation of technical solutions such as cameras or trusted traders proved fruitless in october  theresa may who had replaced cameron as prime minister told the tory party conference the uk would leave the single market the first of her red lines as she was speaking to appease the right wing of the party and neuter ukip support in the country the irish government was growing increasingly worried about the border in october kenny agreed with the european commission president jean claude juncker that technical talks between officials in brussels and dublin would open they met again in january  and agreed there was no technical solution to the border they were beginning to realise that only a political solution specifically regulatory alignment between northern ireland and the eu could avert a hard border this was the genesis of the backstop that conviction grew when may gave her lancaster house speech later in january hardening her red lines promising the uk would leave the customs union and the single market brexit did not mean brexit it meant hard brexit in brussels and dublin it was decided that the uk now had to own the border issue all they had extracted out of britain so far was a line in may s speech that there would be no return to the borders of the past that was no good to us said one source that referenced watchtowers and guns but this is not what the border issue was about we were never going back there this was about the customs union and the single market the turning point came a few months later in a keynote speech by kenny who for the first time indicated the bilateral approach was dead and avoiding a post brexit hard border was now vital for the republic s national interest it was a shift in ireland s position born out of the investigations into the border technical issues conducted with the commission over the previous five months the irish goal was to get the border into a legally binding withdrawal agreement dublin s point of maximum leverage rather than future trade relations when dublin would struggle to be heard rumours that ireland was angling for a legally binding solution spooked the then brexit secretary david davis a scheduled meeting with ireland s deputy prime minister was mysteriously cancelled when they heard what was potentially to be discussed he suddenly wasn t available said a source the relationship with david davis was not good the irish discounted downing street promises to keep the border as frictionless as possible viewing the british as slippery saying the right things but not necessarily delivering said a source close to the talks they had decades of experience of negotiations with the british over northern ireland and knew what they would be like ireland was a midget with a big advantage british ineptitude downing street failed to plan for brexit before the referendum and never caught up conservative party divisions split the cabinet and sabotaged attempts to clarify goals and strategy may compounded her difficulties by calling an election in june  that lost her parliamentary majority and made her dependent on the democratic unionist party dup the dup opposed any special status for northern ireland lest it weaken the union the prime minister tried to appease the dup by widening the backstop to encompass the uk not just northern ireland but this angered brexiters downing street s road to perdition began with three incompatible commitments leaving the single market and customs union the uk jumping together and no hard border in ireland logic said you could have two not three brexiters squared this by saying any backstop would be a convenient fiction and not really legally

2552,"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, trying to make sense of the nonsensical since June 2016. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And catch our monthly Brexit Means podcast here.After all that excitement, the briefing is taking a break and will be back on 30 April.And: breathe. Two days before Britain could have been forced to leave the EU without a deal, the EU27 agreed that it could remain a member until 31 October, with the option to leave earlier if Theresa May can secure Commons support for her deal.After six hours, leaders endorsed a “flextension” with a Halloween cliff-edge to keep pressure on the Commons and a June summit that will review the UK’s behaviour as a member state, after France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, expressed concerns about Britain’s capacity to undermine the European project.Back in London, May sent exhausted MPs home for a 10-day Easter break, urging them to “reflect on the decisions that will have to be made swiftly on our return”. She stressed she would pursue cross-party talks aimed at finding a Brexit consensus and shrugged off calls for her resignation from backbenchers angry at its delay.The extension means Britain will have to hold European parliamentary elections unless MPs ratify the thrice-rejected withdrawal agreement by 22 May. This has angered some Tory MPs, who threatened to boycott the election campaign and expressed fears for party activists’ safety.As the government continued some no-deal planning but stood down 6,000 civil servants engaged in it, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, insisted the delay had not increased the prospect of a second referendum and said he still expected Britain to leave the EU.David Lidington, the prime minister’s de facto deputy, said the government and Labour must reach a compromise around a customs union if a deal was to be reached, while sources close to the talks said they would not advance much further unless May softened her red lines.As a new opinion poll showed Tory support plummeting to a five-year low, a former Conservative cabinet minister, Stephen Dorrell, defected to the independent Change UK group, and ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith urged May to step down before the EU elections. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said any Tory leadership contest must wait until a Brexit deal had been agreed.Meanwhile former Ukip leader Nigel Farage launched his new Brexit party to great fanfare, promising it would not be taking money from Arron Banks but would be fielding as the first of its European election candidates Annunziata Rees-Mogg, the sister of hardline Brexiter Jacob.Several scenarios remain open for May. Labour and the Conservatives could reach cross-party agreement likely to achieve a Commons majority, although it is unclear whether leave-supporting cabinet ministers would accept the necessary compromises.If no agreement is reached, May has said she hopes to persuade the opposition to sign up to a process of parliamentary votes – but there, too, it is unclear whether a majority would emerge for any particular option.The PM continues to believe her deal is the best way forward and could yet bring it back to the Commons, perhaps as one option among a series of indicative votes. With the Conservatives polling poorly, however, an election is seen as unlikely, and May will be unwilling to opt for a second referendum or to resign.My colleague Jessica Elgot put together an exceptionally useful timeline of the key dates between now and the end of the Brexit extension on 31 October, and here is a guide to what the EU27 offer means for politics, business, citizens and the EU.UK businesses at most gloomy since referendum, says DeloitteDangerous products could swamp UK after Brexit, warns Which? magazinePeople’s Vote campaigners vow to overhaul ‘project fear’ imageDavid Lammy says comparing ERG to Nazis ‘not strong enough’Judge orders Ukip to reveal EU referendum data useTiming of May’s ‘festival of Britain’ risks Irish angerPro-EU parties to use European elections as ‘soft referendum’IMF says Brexit delay means businesses face more uncertaintyDavid Cameron memoir still set for autumn, despite Brexit extensionMore than 400,000 EU nationals apply to stay in UK after BrexitIn the Guardian, former European commissioner and World Trade Organization boss Pascal Lamy says staying in a customs union after Brexit won’t resolve everything:Clearly, staying in a customs union would not be enough to solve the Irish border question. To take just one commonly cited example: if the UK remains in the customs union but imports chlorinated poultry from the US, there has to be a border, because the EU does not accept chlorinated poultry. This is a rule of the single market. Being in a customs union might be better than not being in a customs union, but it would come with very real downsides too. It is important that these are also considered. The UK now has limited time to make a more informed judgement about what happens next. Whatever it decides, it should do so with its eyes wide open. Otherwise, we could all soon find ourselves back on the cliff edge.And Aditya Chakrabortty argues that, while the Tories once had a radical fringe, Brexit means it now encompasses the whole party:The Conservative party is becoming the natural party of extremists. It is the new home for hardliners, catastrophists and those wishing to take up permanent residence in la-la land … It is the home of the radical right. That defines the Brexit project; it is also the dying embers of Thatcherism. And so a long and honourable tradition in British politics dies in front of us, in plain sight. Look at the men and women vying to replace May and they look little different from the Tories you used to know. Their suits are as traditionally roomy, the haircuts just as artless and the complexion as reliably white. But the party they wish to head is now a haven for conspiracy theorists, cranks and career cowards.Political scientist Matthew Goodwin lays out the damage the ongoing Brexit omnishambles is doing to

2645,"It was meant to be a glimmer of positivity to unite a divided nation – a festival to celebrate the best of British, bring communities together and strengthen “our precious union”.Yet Theresa May is being warned that her plan for a Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland risks doing the opposite. The planned 2022 event, announced at last year’s Conservative conference, was criticised as a headline-grabbing distraction. But May now faces concerns that the timing clashes with the centenary of Irish partition and the civil war. Arts industry figures in Northern Ireland and some of those involved in the peace process are also understood to have concerns. These worries are revealed in a report by the thinktank British Future, which examined the potential for arts and heritage to bring the nation together. The study calls on the festival to be delayed by at least three years.What is now the Irish republic became the Irish Free State in 1922, while Northern Ireland remained part of the UK. A civil war erupted among Irish nationalists over the remaining links with Britain and raged for a year. Sunder Katwala, the report’s author, said: “Holding a festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 2022, on the centenary of Ireland’s partition and civil war, would be the worst possible timing. It is only likely to heighten tensions between communities – and that’s before we know Brexit’s implications for the border. Right across the UK, a festival so closely associated with Brexit may only reinforce divides when it could be bridging them.”Jonathan Powell, Tory Blair’s former chief of staff and one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement, also warned against anything that could inflame tensions, which have worsened given the prominent role of the Irish border in the Brexit debate.“There is going to be a lot of rebuilding to do in Anglo-Irish relations, which had been put on a completely new footing over the last 20 years and were then trashed by the Brexiters over the last couple of years,” he said. “An example is their constant attacks on [Irish prime minister Leo] Varadkar for hostility when all he is doing is protecting the interests of the Irish people. I fear it will take years to put this right.”The idea of a nationwide event was modelled on the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the Festival of Britain a century later, held to boost the nation’s spirits after the second world war. May was mocked on social media when she announced she was setting aside £120m to prepare for the event, with some suggesting the festival would only feature damp tents on village greens, an exhibition of the remaining avocados left in Britain and morris dancers. However, after holding focus groups, British Future found it could be more popular than critics think, should organisers get the tone and timing right. More than six in 10 thought the festival a good idea, with only one in 10 opposed, according to new ICM research.“The festival could be much more popular with the public than its social media critics think, and could help bridge social divides if done well,” Katwala said. “If not, it could be a second Millennium Dome. It risks being neglected, with the government stuck over Brexit and the prime minister who thought of it on her way out. The next prime minister will have to decide how to rescue this idea.”",Timing of May’s ‘festival of Britain’ risks Irish anger,2019-04-13/16:00:22,it was meant to be a glimmer of positivity to unite a divided nation a festival to celebrate the best of british bring communities together and strengthen our precious union yet theresa may is being warned that her plan for a festival of great britain and northern ireland risks doing the opposite the planned  event announced at last year s conservative conference was criticised as a headline grabbing distraction but may now faces concerns that the timing clashes with the centenary of irish partition and the civil war arts industry figures in northern ireland and some of those involved in the peace process are also understood to have concerns these worries are revealed in a report by the thinktank british future which examined the potential for arts and heritage to bring the nation together the study calls on the festival to be delayed by at least three years what is now the irish republic became the irish free state in  while northern ireland remained part of the uk a civil war erupted among irish nationalists over the remaining links with britain and raged for a year sunder katwala the report s author said holding a festival of great britain and northern ireland in  on the centenary of ireland s partition and civil war would be the worst possible timing it is only likely to heighten tensions between communities and that s before we know brexit s implications for the border right across the uk a festival so closely associated with brexit may only reinforce divides when it could be bridging them jonathan powell tory blair s former chief of staff and one of the architects of the good friday agreement also warned against anything that could inflame tensions which have worsened given the prominent role of the irish border in the brexit debate there is going to be a lot of rebuilding to do in anglo irish relations which had been put on a completely new footing over the last  years and were then trashed by the brexiters over the last couple of years he said an example is their constant attacks on irish prime minister leo varadkar for hostility when all he is doing is protecting the interests of the irish people i fear it will take years to put this right the idea of a nationwide event was modelled on the great exhibition of  and the festival of britain a century later held to boost the nation s spirits after the second world war may was mocked on social media when she announced she was setting aside m to prepare for the event with some suggesting the festival would only feature damp tents on village greens an exhibition of the remaining avocados left in britain and morris dancers however after holding focus groups british future found it could be more popular than critics think should organisers get the tone and timing right more than six in  thought the festival a good idea with only one in  opposed according to new icm research the festival could be much more popular with the public than its social media critics think and could help bridge social divides if done well katwala said if not it could be a second millennium dome it risks being neglected with the government stuck over brexit and the prime minister who thought of it on her way out the next prime minister will have to decide how to rescue this idea ,Brexit,0.18155315518379211
2740,"Halloween might look like a fitting date for the end of the Brexit horror story, European media said, but Britain was by no means certain to leave the EU even then – and in any case, the damage had already been done.“‘Brexit means Brexit’, as Theresa May repeated for so long?” said France’s Libération. “Not really. You have to ask whether the UK will ever leave. The prime minister won a new delay from her EU partners: to 31 October. The date is not a very good omen … ”But whether Britain leaves in the autumn, or before, or not at all, the paper said, the “increasingly incomprehensible waltz of exit dates shows it has already succeeded in exporting its byzantine internal battles to Brussels … This summit shattered the united front that the Europeans had maintained for so long.”Barcelona’s La Vanguardia said the damage extended some way further than that. The basic problem remains “the inability of the two main British parties to interpret the decision taken by the people,” it said, leading to anger and resentment on both sides of the Channel.“Those who voted for Brexit have reason to feel aggrieved that after three years the UK is still a member of the EU. But the citizens of the 27 other member states also have reason to feel aggrieved at the way Brexit is sapping energy that could be spent on the great challenge of guaranteeing the social wellbeing of Europe’s citizens.”Italy’s La Stampa was not optimistic for the future. “Whatever the outcome of the last act of this tragedy, Brexit is destined to mark the future of Europe for at least a generation,” it said. “Confidence between the UK and the continent has been broken in a lasting way. And without mutual trust no project, political or commercial, is possible.”France’s Le Monde agreed Halloween, “the Anglo-Saxon festival of witches and pumpkins”, was perhaps a fitting date. But to agree on it, the paper said, the EU27 had to reach “a hard-fought and typically European compromise”.A majority of leaders, including Germany’s Angela Merkel, wanted “to put Brexit on ice for a year, allowing the bloc to get through a politically tricky period”. France’s Emmanuel Macron, however, wanted a far shorter extension, “to keep maximum pressure on the British … and put an end to the can-kicking”.In the end, the EU27 split the difference but “the Franco-German motor was clearly not functioning”, Le Monde said. And it remained the question “whether Brexit will ever actually happen … If Britain persists in its refusal to accept the exit deal and its incapacity to agree on the form of Brexit it wants, the EU, too, will face an impasse.”Germany’s Die Welt also felt the summit, even if it ended in a classic EU compromise, had shown Brexit “is no longer a British affair”. Macron’s hard line “aimed to scare the populists in his own country off similar anti-EU plans,” it said, while Berlin “sees a longer term danger in a lack of willingness to compromise”.For Die Zeit, the chosen exit date “could not be more symbolic: on 31 October, when the Halloween festival of horrors is being celebrated everywhere, Britain is set to leave the EU. For many, in Britain and on the continent, a truly scary moment … ”“It’s a Halloween Brexit,” echoed the Netherlands’ NRC Handelsblad, arguing that despite Macron’s warnings the final summit outcome reflected above all “the desire of almost all member states to avoid a no-deal Brexit – they set virtually no conditions on Britain’s continued membership, just a ‘good behaviour review’ in June.”Macron’s fears that a long extension would allow Britain to disrupt EU proceedings were overblown, the paper said: “There is little new legislation programmed this year, and important decisions such as the new president of the commission can by taken by majority vote.”",'It's a Halloween Brexit': European media's verdict on latest delay,2019-04-11/10:29:13,halloween might look like a fitting date for the end of the brexit horror story european media said but britain was by no means certain to leave the eu even then and in any case the damage had already been done brexit means brexit as theresa may repeated for so long said france s libération not really you have to ask whether the uk will ever leave the prime minister won a new delay from her eu partners to  october the date is not a very good omen but whether britain leaves in the autumn or before or not at all the paper said the increasingly incomprehensible waltz of exit dates shows it has already succeeded in exporting its byzantine internal battles to brussels this summit shattered the united front that the europeans had maintained for so long barcelona s la vanguardia said the damage extended some way further than that the basic problem remains the inability of the two main british parties to interpret the decision taken by the people it said leading to anger and resentment on both sides of the channel those who voted for brexit have reason to feel aggrieved that after three years the uk is still a member of the eu but the citizens of the  other member states also have reason to feel aggrieved at the way brexit is sapping energy that could be spent on the great challenge of guaranteeing the social wellbeing of europe s citizens italy s la stampa was not optimistic for the future whatever the outcome of the last act of this tragedy brexit is destined to mark the future of europe for at least a generation it said confidence between the uk and the continent has been broken in a lasting way and without mutual trust no project political or commercial is possible france s le monde agreed halloween the anglo saxon festival of witches and pumpkins was perhaps a fitting date but to agree on it the paper said the eu had to reach a hard fought and typically european compromise a majority of leaders including germany s angela merkel wanted to put brexit on ice for a year allowing the bloc to get through a politically tricky period france s emmanuel macron however wanted a far shorter extension to keep maximum pressure on the british and put an end to the can kicking in the end the eu split the difference but the franco german motor was clearly not functioning le monde said and it remained the question whether brexit will ever actually happen if britain persists in its refusal to accept the exit deal and its incapacity to agree on the form of brexit it wants the eu too will face an impasse germany s die welt also felt the summit even if it ended in a classic eu compromise had shown brexit is no longer a british affair macron s hard line aimed to scare the populists in his own country off similar anti eu plans it said while berlin sees a longer term danger in a lack of willingness to compromise for die zeit the chosen exit date could not be more symbolic on  october when the halloween festival of horrors is being celebrated everywhere britain is set to leave the eu for many in britain and on the continent a truly scary moment it s a halloween brexit echoed the netherlands nrc handelsblad arguing that despite macron s warnings the final summit outcome reflected above all the desire of almost all member states to avoid a no deal brexit they set virtually no conditions on britain s continued membership just a good behaviour review in june macron s fears that a long extension would allow britain to disrupt eu proceedings were overblown the paper said there is little new legislation programmed this year and important decisions such as the new president of the commission can by taken by majority vote ,Brexit,0.2698895335197449
2751,"Britain will remain in the EU until the end of October this year, but diminished in power and status, with a review of its conduct set for the end of June. It is the marital equivalent of being sent to sleep in the spare bedroom, if not quite the garden shed.Wednesday night’s humiliation, when 27 other nations decided our fate – a taster of Norway-plus or “common market 2.0”, where decisions are made about the UK without our presence – exposes the lies of the Brexiters and the impossibility of a strong and stable position outside the EU. History will recall that Britons did not value their power in Europe until they lost it. Theresa May, too, was humiliated once again but it does not cut deeply since she appears to feels no shame. She remains convinced she was and is right: that blame is to be found with her detractors and not with her deal or leadership.The question that remains unanswered is: now what? Few EU leaders were convinced that the process of cross-party talks would lead to a deal that parliament could support, and rightly so. It is not in Jeremy Corbyn’s interest to rescue the Conservative party from a crisis of their own making. And for May, any deal acceptable to the Labour party would cause a perhaps permanent split in her own party, not seen since 1846 and the repeal of the corn laws.That’s why these negotiations were never offered in good faith – if they had been, the hardline Brexiters in the cabinet would have already resigned. Cabinet ministers from Jeremy Hunt to Geoffrey Cox seem unable to hide their duplicitous intentions, all but promising that a future Tory leader would rip up any deal.But none of this matters. Even if May and Corbyn were to reach a deal for a soft Brexit without a confirmatory public vote, then the bulk of Tory MPs would vote against it on substance and Labour MPs would vote it down on process. If May were to attempt to impose a three-line whip for a “people’s vote”, her government would shatter.If they were to conclude a deal, the party leaders could face a situation where the only MPs voting for it were on both frontbenches. It is the path pursued by desperate aides to the prime minister, but with little traction either in parliament, in the Tory party or in the labour movement.So it is a matter of when, not if, the talks between May and Corbyn break up. It seems quite likely that both sides will allow the fiction to continue during parliamentary recess so everyone can have a break (and who could blame them?). Indeed, both sides will remain around the table to avoid being seen to leave it first. Expect the blame game to get into full swing now.Yet the reality is that there is no parliamentary majority for any Brexit outcome – from no-deal through every variation of a Brexit deal, all the way to revocation – meaning that the only options left are processes. While the prime minister may attempt another round of indicative votes and yet another attempt to get her deal through, it will not succeed.Yet despite serving no useful purpose by remaining in office, May refuses to leave. If she were to resign as prime minister at the end of June she would avoid the embarrassment of serving a shorter time in office than Gordon Brown while giving her successor time to regroup over the summer.But be under no illusions: a new Tory leader and prime minister will not bring with them a fresh solution to the crisis. The parliamentary arithmetic will be unaltered.Whether now or in a few months hence, parliament will be confronted with a choice: either refer the Brexit question back to the people for their final say, or hold a general election to deliver a parliament capable of making a decision.In any general election, the Labour party will offer a minimum of a renegotiation and a referendum or even a promise to revoke article 50. When confronted with a choice between a referendum under a Conservative government or a referendum following a Labour election victory, enough Tory MPs may conclude that supporting a public vote now is the lesser of two evils.Either way, May’s premiership is doomed – and so may be the project to rip this country out of the EU.

2758,"For three years, Brexit arguments have, naturally enough, focused on the impact that leaving the European Union might have on Britain. Less attention has been paid to the effect of Britain’s departure on the rest of Europe. That is about to change. The response of European neighbours to choices forced on them by the UK is getting harder to ignore.A long article 50 extension would cover a turbulent phase in the European political cycle: European parliament elections; the appointment of a new commission; budget negotiations; the expiry of Donald Tusk’s term as council president. There is no precedent to indicate whether an exiting member can or should participate in those processes.EU summits have always been conducted on the assumption that everyone wants a collegiate outcome. There is still disagreement, deadlock and strife, but they are contained by a framework of common enterprise. That is no longer true with Brexit Britain, which is why other European leaders, led by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, want to curtail UK privileges as the price of an article 50 extension.It is not easy to sustain trust between a bloc of 27 EU members and a former ally loitering at the exit. It is much harder when the ruling party of the exiting country is a wellspring of anti-Brussels venom and when its MPs threaten to use their ongoing access to EU institutions for obstruction and vandalism. The breakdown in confidence works two ways. British ministers worry that any downgrade in status will be exploited to write anti-UK bias into the rules of future engagement across the Channel. But that is an intrinsic hazard of Brexit. There is no avoiding the diminution of influence that comes from surrendering a seat in the continent’s decision-making forums.The leave campaign denied it was so. Brexiters promised that Britain would be the stronger side in negotiations with the rest of Europe; that they needed us more than we needed them. It is true that Theresa May had cards to play: British economic clout and military and intelligence capabilities are assets that the EU would rather not lose. But that leverage had to be exercised delicately. The shrewd way would have been to signal moral and strategic support for the European project, develop diplomatic goodwill and then use British assets to purchase influence for the long term. But the opposite happened. Brexit came across as an aggressive project, culturally aligned to Donald Trump’s anti-Europeanism, which provoked an impulse in Brussels to minimise British influence. That wasn’t Mrs May’s intention, but she allowed virulent anti-EU nationalism to run wild in her party.EU leaders are frustrated with Britain, but they also recognise the necessity of maintaining healthy relations. The impulse to be rid of a nuisance neighbour is balanced by the calculation that an alienated, vindictive Britain poses more long-term threats. Sadly, the same equation is poorly understood in this country. Brexiters itch to escape EU institutional entanglements, but the country can never achieve pristine separation from the European project. Managing partnerships with our continental neighbours is an immovable fact of geography, diplomacy and economics. One approach to Brexit delay would be to reset those partnerships in a more constructive spirit. Another is to make them as difficult and dysfunctional as possible. It is clear which is the wiser path, but sadly also clear that Mrs May and her party are incapable of following it.",The Guardian view on Britain in Europe: an inevitable partnership,2019-04-10/18:34:20,for three years brexit arguments have naturally enough focused on the impact that leaving the european union might have on britain less attention has been paid to the effect of britain s departure on the rest of europe that is about to change the response of european neighbours to choices forced on them by the uk is getting harder to ignore a long article  extension would cover a turbulent phase in the european political cycle european parliament elections the appointment of a new commission budget negotiations the expiry of donald tusk s term as council president there is no precedent to indicate whether an exiting member can or should participate in those processes eu summits have always been conducted on the assumption that everyone wants a collegiate outcome there is still disagreement deadlock and strife but they are contained by a framework of common enterprise that is no longer true with brexit britain which is why other european leaders led by the french president emmanuel macron want to curtail uk privileges as the price of an article  extension it is not easy to sustain trust between a bloc of  eu members and a former ally loitering at the exit it is much harder when the ruling party of the exiting country is a wellspring of anti brussels venom and when its mps threaten to use their ongoing access to eu institutions for obstruction and vandalism the breakdown in confidence works two ways british ministers worry that any downgrade in status will be exploited to write anti uk bias into the rules of future engagement across the channel but that is an intrinsic hazard of brexit there is no avoiding the diminution of influence that comes from surrendering a seat in the continent s decision making forums the leave campaign denied it was so brexiters promised that britain would be the stronger side in negotiations with the rest of europe that they needed us more than we needed them it is true that theresa may had cards to play british economic clout and military and intelligence capabilities are assets that the eu would rather not lose but that leverage had to be exercised delicately the shrewd way would have been to signal moral and strategic support for the european project develop diplomatic goodwill and then use british assets to purchase influence for the long term but the opposite happened brexit came across as an aggressive project culturally aligned to donald trump s anti europeanism which provoked an impulse in brussels to minimise british influence that wasn t mrs may s intention but she allowed virulent anti eu nationalism to run wild in her party eu leaders are frustrated with britain but they also recognise the necessity of maintaining healthy relations the impulse to be rid of a nuisance neighbour is balanced by the calculation that an alienated vindictive britain poses more long term threats sadly the same equation is poorly understood in this country brexiters itch to escape eu institutional entanglements but the country can never achieve pristine separation from the european project managing partnerships with our continental neighbours is an immovable fact of geography diplomacy and economics one approach to brexit delay would be to reset those partnerships in a more constructive spirit another is to make them as difficult and dysfunctional as possible it is clear which is the wiser path but sadly also clear that mrs may and her party are incapable of following it ,Brexit,0.1902945190668106
2914,"Brexit has prompted a recurring nightmare among an increasingly incredulous population: our very own Groundhog Day. Two weeks after the EU granted us an 11th-hour extension to prevent us crashing out without a deal, we are back in exactly the same position. The only thing standing between us and next Friday’s cliff edge is the hope the EU gifts us another extension. Meanwhile, the political turmoil engulfing the country worsens, the two main parties increasingly consumed by division and disarray and the political leadership we so desperately need to avert crisis as elusive as ever.It’s hard to believe that the Westminster model of democracy was one prized by constitutional theorists for the stability it purportedly delivers. As the stakes get higher, our political system has proved less and less capable of delivering a resolution to the gridlock that has infected Westminster.Labour has to choose between backing a referendum or striking a compromise on a softer BrexitBrexit has been a story of the favouring of party management over the national interest. From the very beginning, Theresa May’s approach to Brexit – from her premature decision to trigger article 50 to her red lines on freedom of movement and the customs union – has been driven not by a strategy to unite the country in the wake of a divisive referendum but to keep her Brexit ultras on side. Only now it has become clear that there are MPs in her party so fanatically dogmatic that they would rather hold out for no deal than vote for her deal has she opened compromise talks with Labour. But Labour emerged from the talks on Friday complaining that no changes to the political declaration were on offer, suggesting that this move may have been more about trying to lay blame for any further delay on the opposition.Labour’s strategy has been no less determined by party interest. Jeremy Corbyn has kept a position of barely credible ambiguity for as long as possible to avoid alienating any of its voters. Labour has maintained the charade that it could deliver a Brexit deal that delivers all the benefits of EU membership with none of costs. And Labour has failed to provide any leadership support for a confirmatory referendum on any Brexit deal, with the shadow cabinet split on the issue.Time is running out for Labour to decide once and for all whether it will properly swing its weight behind a referendum. Thanks to the mess the Tories are in, Corbyn is in a position of power, if he only chooses to use it. He could tell May that Labour MPs will back her withdrawal agreement only if she is prepared to put it to a confirmatory referendum. There is every chance that this would generate a cross-party majority for a referendum.Parliament should lead a national conversation with the public to shape negotiations with the EU in the coming yearsIt would be the right thing for Labour to do in principle. The terms of our exit are now clear in a way they simply weren’t when Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016. Voters were made misleading promises during that campaign. It would be unthinkable to leave without putting the terms of our exit back to voters for ratification.But it is also the right thing for Labour to do electorally. It can no longer credibly sit on the fence. Three-quarters of Labour voters think Britain was wrong to vote to leave the EU. With no failsafe way of triggering a general election, Labour has to choose between backing a referendum or striking a compromise on a softer Brexit. But the latter is fraught with danger: there are no guarantees that May can make that would be binding on any successor, were there to be a general election during the negotiations about our future relationship with the EU. Labour could end up being blamed for facilitating a hard Brexit.If the EU does grant us a long extension, the biggest risk is that it simply gets wasted and we find ourselves here again for a third time in a few months. If recent weeks have shown anything, it’s that not even the most perilous cliff edge is enough to force a deal. A long extension could see both parties slide backwards from compromise. The Conservative party looks likely to select a hard Brexiter to succeed May, one who might set tougher red lines around which it is harder, not easier, to generate a parliamentary consensus. Labour might simply return to a position of constructive ambiguity.It is imperative that any long extension is put to good use. MPs must rally behind holding a confirmatory referendum giving a choice between any agreed withdrawal agreement versus the status quo. If the public votes to accept the withdrawal agreement, that still leaves a big question mark over our future relationship with Europe. Parliament should lead a national conversation with the public, using citizens’ assemblies, to shape negotiations with the EU in the coming years. It is far too important to leave to the dominant faction of a single political party.The chaos over Brexit will likely have done irreparable damage to public confidence in our political system. Our two-party, majoritarian political system has struggled to represent the preferences of a more pluralistic electorate, divided on issues such as Brexit that cross the left-right spectrum. The current political crisis is not just the product of an utter vacuum of contemporary political leadership but of the strong incentives in our political system for leaders to try to hold their parties together above all else. MPs must use the coming weeks to find a way out of this ruinous stasis.

3165,"The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has accused the government of running down the clock and “bullying and threatening” MPs as it tried to force through Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Speaking in Newport, south Wales, before a byelection on Thursday, Corbyn also refused to say what his party’s parliamentary tactics would be during a second round of indicative votes due to take place on Monday.He said that the option of giving the public a confirmatory referendum on any Brexit deal “is the Labour position so far, but there hasn’t been enough support for that across the floor in the House of Commons”.During this week’s indicative votes, the option for a public vote was whipped by Labour but was defeated by 295 to 268 votes, with 27 of the party’s MPs rebelling.Corbyn said: “The absolute priority at the moment is to end this chaos the government has brought us to by their endlessly running down the clock and basically bullying and threatening people. The bullying hasn’t worked, the threats haven’t worked. It’s time now for the sensible people to take over.”He cautioned: “This is a very dangerous period, because if we crash out without a deal then the supply chains get interrupted, jobs are at stake, and also the sense of security of many EU nationals living in Britain, and of course British people living across Europe.”Labour would propose a deal involving a customs union with the EU to prevent the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland, Corbyn said.“We are working very hard on that and reaching out to people all across the Commons, and I have been doing that all this week and obviously I’ll be doing that all this weekend,” he added.“However people voted in the referendum, no one voted to lose their jobs, no one voted to be worse off, and no one voted to deregulate our society.“I think the obvious choice is the one I suggested, which would be a good economic relationship with Europe that could be negotiated.

3166,"Having long ago decided that there was no point expecting anything sensible to emerge from Westminster Brexit-wise, Europe’s press greeted the inevitable third Commons defeat for Theresa May’s deal with a collective, if bitter, shrug.“Season four of Brexiternity is now under way and will probably air next week,” said France’s Libération, breezily. “After three defeats, the PM is supposedly going to try a fourth time. Unreal? Unthinkable? Of course not. Uncertainty reigns, there is no plan B, and all options, more or less, remain open.”Le Figaro did not spare the irony. “The day Britain was supposed to leave the EU, its parliament voted against the exit deal while thousands of demonstrators protested outside against the ‘treason’ of their politicians,” the paper said.“And now? If the country has been in the grip of political chaos for months, the period that lies ahead looks set to attain hitherto unexplored heights of uncertainty. Unless a solution is found, Britain will crash out of EU without a deal on 12 April.”The Irish Independent said classic comedy fans were now “running out of Brexit analogies”. Monty Python’s Black Knight and dead parrot had already been enlisted to portray Theresa May and her deal, the paper said, while Laurel and Hardy were sadly unavailable to do justice to Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson.“But the humour is becoming dark as the gallows of Brexit approaches,” it added. “All options have now been examined, and the inability of Britain’s parliamentary system to find any sort of resolution makes a mockery of their democracy.”In Germany, Die Zeit said Britain was “in dire straits: parliament and government are at odds. If they do not agree within a few days, the country risks serious economic and political chaos, causing great suffering to future generations.”The country has been “living from one deadline to the next for weeks, without a clear way out”, it said. “The people no longer know who rules them, or where their politics is taking them. There is not a Briton who is not shocked. Brexit has not made Britain stronger: it is in a sorry state.”The fault was not all May’s, it added. “But she has led not in the national interest, but to preserve the popularity of the Conservative party … Not consensus, diplomacy and conviction, but stubborn self-interest,” it argued. Now the system has “one last chance” to avoid a disastrous no deal.Belgium’s De Standaard said in an editorial that the deal’s third defeat showed how deeply Britain was now divided. “It was no real surprise,” the paper said. “Just the final proof that the British political system has been completely broken by Brexit.

It’s as if two years of political crisis have served for nothing.”The Netherlands’ De Volkskrant said Brexit was now “in injury time”, while Corriere della Serra in Italy reckoned that the prime minister had “lost her bet”: her deal’s third defeat showed that her promise to resign if the agreement was passed “was worth nothing”. Brexit, the paper said, is now “reaching the final crossroad”.Poland’s Gazeta Wyborcza said “weeks of negotiations, scary nightmare scenarios, and even the promise of her own resignation” had not helped May convince MPs to back the divorce agreement reached with Brussels. “What’s next with Brexit?” it asked. “Who knows?”",From shock to shrugs: Europe’s press react to third Brexit deal defeat,2019-03-30/16:18:56+0000,having long ago decided that there was no point expecting anything sensible to emerge from westminster brexit wise europe s press greeted the inevitable third commons defeat for theresa may s deal with a collective if bitter shrug season four of brexiternity is now under way and will probably air next week said france s libération breezily after three defeats the pm is supposedly going to try a fourth time unreal unthinkable of course not uncertainty reigns there is no plan b and all options more or less remain open le figaro did not spare the irony the day britain was supposed to leave the eu its parliament voted against the exit deal while thousands of demonstrators protested outside against the treason of their politicians the paper said and now if the country has been in the grip of political chaos for months the period that lies ahead looks set to attain hitherto unexplored heights of uncertainty unless a solution is found britain will crash out of eu without a deal on  april the irish independent said classic comedy fans were now running out of brexit analogies monty python s black knight and dead parrot had already been enlisted to portray theresa may and her deal the paper said while laurel and hardy were sadly unavailable to do justice to jacob rees mogg and boris johnson but the humour is becoming dark as the gallows of brexit approaches it added all options have now been examined and the inability of britain s parliamentary system to find any sort of resolution makes a mockery of their democracy in germany die zeit said britain was in dire straits parliament and government are at odds if they do not agree within a few days the country risks serious economic and political chaos causing great suffering to future generations the country has been living from one deadline to the next for weeks without a clear way out it said the people no longer know who rules them or where their politics is taking them there is not a briton who is not shocked brexit has not made britain stronger it is in a sorry state the fault was not all may s it added but she has led not in the national interest but to preserve the popularity of the conservative party not consensus diplomacy and conviction but stubborn self interest it argued now the system has one last chance to avoid a disastrous no deal belgium s de standaard said in an editorial that the deal s third defeat showed how deeply britain was now divided it was no real surprise the paper said just the final proof that the british political system has been completely broken by brexit in essence it added there is no majority to be found for any form of brexit sweden s dagens nyheter said that although everything in britain has revolved around brexit for what seems like for ever the country appears now to be back at square one may s agreement has been voted down for the third time almost anything can happen it s as if two years of political crisis have served for nothing the netherlands de volkskrant said brexit was now in injury time while corriere della serra in italy reckoned that the prime minister had lost her bet her deal s third defeat showed that her promise to resign if the agreement was passed was worth nothing brexit the paper said is now reaching the final crossroad poland s gazeta wyborcza said weeks of negotiations scary nightmare scenarios and even the promise of her own resignation had not helped may convince mps to back the divorce agreement reached with brussels what s next with brexit it asked who knows ,Brexit,0.23502540588378906
3258,"Donald Tusk issued a rallying call to the “increasing majority” of British people who want to cancel Brexit and stay in the EU, hours before MPs were given the chance to back a second referendum.In a stirring intervention on Wednesday, the European council president praised those who marched on the streets of London and the millions who are petitioning the government to revoke article 50.Speaking to the European parliament, Tusk reprimanded those who voiced concerns about a potential lengthy extension to article 50 in the event of the Commons rejecting the withdrawal agreement again this week.Tusk said: “Let me make one personal remark to the members of this parliament. Before the European council, I said that we should be open to a long extension if the UK wishes to rethink its Brexit strategy, which would of course mean the UK’s participation in the European parliament elections. And then there were voices saying that this would be harmful or inconvenient to some of you.“Let me be clear: such thinking is unacceptable. You cannot betray the 6 million people who signed the petition to revoke article 50, the 1 million people who marched for a people’s vote, or the increasing majority of people who want to remain in the European Union.”To heckling from Ukip MEPs, Tusk went on: “They may feel that they are not sufficiently represented by the UK parliament, but they must feel that they are represented by you in this chamber. Because they are Europeans.”In London, MPs voted to seize control of the parliamentary timetable on Monday to allow the House of Commons to explore over the coming days whether there could be support for alternatives to Theresa May’s twice-defeated Brexit deal, including a possible second public vote.That proposal, put forward by the former Labour cabinet minister Margaret Beckett, lost by 27 votes on Wednesday evening, the second smallest loss among the eight solutions to the Brexit impasse, offering some hope to campaigners in future votes to come. But EU sources said they were concerned that the UK parliament was still unable to coalesce around a solution, saying: “Our interlocutor remains the British government.”The Guardian revealed on Wednesday morning that the EU has pencilled in April Fools’ Day 2020 as a first day for the UK outside the bloc since 1973 if May fails to ratify her deal but seeks a long extension of article 50 on the basis that a new plan has emerged.The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage responded to Tusk by describing him as “deluded” and claiming that a second referendum would deliver a larger majority for leave.In a pantomime moment, Farage turned to those sat behind him to ask whether they really wanted him to return as an MEP. He ended his speech to the parliament by appealing to the EU’s leaders to “get the British out”.Later in the debate, Tusk hit back, saying: “Mr Farage, you have presented passionate arguments against a second referendum. But the truth is that the second referendum took place in 2016 because the first one took place in 1975. And then a vast majority of the British public decided that the place of the UK was in the European Economic Community.“No, it was you who thought three years ago that it was possible to organise a referendum to invalidate the previous one. Then please be consistent also today.”Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, also spoke, saying: “No one is trying to steal Brexit from you, no one is trying to undo the vote of the British people” but, he said, the UK would have to bear the consequences of its decisions.He said the EU’s leaders last week had allowed an extension of article 50 until 12 April to “open the possibility to the UK to shoulder its responsibility – it is now over to this country to shoulder that responsibility”.Tusk’s comments came as the British government emailed the 5.8 million people who have signed a UK parliament petition seeking the revocation of article 50. The email informed signatories that “this government will not revoke article 50”.The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, speaking after Tusk on the subject of Tuesday’s summit, told MEPs he awaited the Commons decision with interest.“The debate on China was far less complicated than the debate on the UK and I was saying to some of you that if I was to compare Great Britain to a sphinx, the sphinx would be an open book by comparison,” Juncker said. “Let’s see how that book speaks over the next week or so.”Barnier warned the British government that the Irish backstop, under which Northern Ireland would stay in the single market and the customs union, would continue to form the basis of the EU’s policy to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.","EU cannot betray ‘increasing majority’ who want UK to remain, says Tusk",2019-03-27/23:20:28+0000,donald tusk issued a rallying call to the increasing majority of british people who

3280,"Concern is growing in Norway and Iceland about how to respond if the UK’s House of Commons votes to apply to join Efta, the four-nation European free-trade association of which both countries are members.While the plan appeals to a growing cross-party lobby of British MPs, who see Efta membership as a compromise solution to leaving the EU yet keeping the UK’s close economic ties with the European single market, it has divided opinion within Efta member states. Iceland’s foreign minister, Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson, a free trader, enthusiastically backed British membership of Efta on a visit to London this week. But he said it would be a challenge if the UK also sought to stay in the EU customs union, as proposed by the chief backers of the Norway option in the Commons. For British MPs, membership of the customs union would ease concerns over the border in Ireland.The four Efta members, Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Switzerland, currently strike their own free-trade deals with third countries outside the European Union, but the UK, if it negotiated to stay inside the EU customs union, would be excluded from doing this. This would reduce the chance of Efta becoming a large and attractive trading bloc, one of the advantages of Britain joining Efta from Iceland’s viewpoint.Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Þórðarson said he was not sure why the UK should wish to join the EU customs union after Brexit and added that any such decision would represent a challenge for Iceland.Iceland’s prime minister, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, was more wary about the UK joining Efta last week, stressing that the UK would need to accept free movement of labour.But in Norway, probably the single most influential country inside Efta, opinion appears to be hardening against UK membership as the option grows more likely. The concern is expressed openly by the opposition Labour party, and more warily in government circles.Anniken Huitfeldt, head of the Foreign and Defence committee and a Labour member, said she was not interested in the UK joining either Efta or the European economic area, the single market grouping that assembles the EU and and Efta members. She said: “We do not encourage them. It is not in Norway’s interests to bring Britain into the EEA … The UK should never have voted to leave the EU in the first place.”The leader of Norway’s opposition Labour party, Jonas Gahr Støre, speaking to the Guardian, expressed his doubts about UK membership of Efta or the European Economic Area. He said: “All decisions are taken by consensus and it is not obvious that Britain and Norway would see eye to eye on all decisions that came from Brussels regarding the internal market. There is in the political debate in Norway a concern that a British presence could make our relationship more unstable, and I think that is reflected in the statements made by the current government and the opposition“Norway would like to see smooth, open and friendly relations with our partners across the North sea. Whether that objective is secured by the UK joining Efta or the EEA is a different question.”He pointed out that after 40 years of membership of the European Union and after 2016 referendum, the British would by joining the EEA “be gaining a new set of obligations but with far less influence and codetermination”. The head of Norway’s business group NHO, Tore Myhre, last week also urged the country not to reopen the agreement by inviting the British into Efta. He said: “Norway’s existing deal is fragile and it is important for us not to put it at risk.”Norway’s foreign minister, Ine Eriksen Søreide, pressed on TV last week to say whether she would support a British application to join Efta, avoided the question, focusing on the need for an orderly Brexit.Similarly, appeals by British MPs that support the Norway option for the Norwegian government to make a public invitation to join Efta have been spurned by ministers anxious not to be seen to be interfering inBrexit politics.Some Norwegian officials say privately that the underlying fear of British Efta membership is that the UK would dominate the organisation, and therefore its negotiations with the EU. One concern is that Norway might have to renegotiate its existing trade deals if the UK became a member.Moreover, it might cast a disruptive light on an arrangement that despite its democratic pitfalls has worked for Norway’s economy by providing access to the EU single market, excluding agriculture and fish.Norway, a country that tries to operate by political consensus, has long accepted an uneasy compromise in which it accepts the four EU freedoms, including freedom of movement, but remains outside the EU, as its citizens voted twice in referenda to reject EU membership. One official said: “There is a wariness about the British controversy over EU relations being imported into our arrangements. The issue has torn the UK apart for two years. We want to avoid upsetting something that works for us.”",Efta countries wary of UK's interest in 'Norway' option,2019-03-27/15:03:24+0000,concern is growing in norway and iceland about how to respond

3283,"Michael Gove has admitted the government’s plan to waive all tariffs on goods crossing the Irish border into Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit could be legally challenged under World Trade Organization rules.The environment secretary told MPs that legal advice had been sought, and it was “certainly the case that other countries could have an arguable case at [the] WTO” over a zero-tariff plan for Ireland.But he said the political needs outweighed those concerns. “We believe there are specific exemptions because of the broader political and security situation in Northern Ireland underpinning the Good Friday agreement, which mean that we can be allowed to do everything that we can.“Of course we couldn’t keep this situation indefinitely but we can do everything we can for a period in order to maintain a frictionless border,” Gove told the environment select committee.Under the no-deal tariff plan the UK would levy import tariffs on beef, lamb, pork and dairy products if it crashed out of the EU but waive them in Northern Ireland to avoid putting infrastructure on the Irish border.The plan, revealed two weeks ago, has caused controversy in Northern Ireland with claims the double standards could prove disastrous for farmers who would face EU tariffs on dairy and meat products exported into Irish food processing plants that made everything from pizza toppings to cheese and infant milk formula.This could be deemed illegal under WTO rules, which must be applied equally to all countries.Neil Parish, a Conservative MP who chairs the committee, told Gove the no-deal tariff regime for Irish exporters would “crush” Northern Ireland’s agrifood industry and lead to bankruptcies and business closures.“It would certainly put Northern Ireland’s agrifood industry at a disadvantage, yes,” Gove replied.He admitted the zero-tariff plan could have a “significant impact” on the dairy industry.Goves warning comes as Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party continues to withhold support for Theresa May’s Brexit deal over Irish border issues.It has put the DUP at odds with local businesses and farmers, who say no deal would be a disaster as they would have to compete with cheaper food coming in from Ireland but face tariffs on their own exports of dairy, beef and lamb across the border.About a third of all Northern Irish milk goes to the Irish Republic to be processed into butter, cheese and infant formula, while 400,000 sheep are exported a year to Ireland for slaughter and meat processing.Parish asked Gove whether he would deploy emergency measures to protect Northern Irish farmers.Gove said he had met representatives from Northern Ireland’s Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs on Monday and had told the department he would “provide whatever support they request to the best of our ability”.Gove revealed his department had 2,800 staff working on Brexit, with 55 seconded from Natural England and 30 from

3313,"Brexit would inflict immediate and profound economic shocks on Ireland, hitting households, businesses and government finances, according to a study.Britain’s departure from the European Union, with or without a deal, would cause significant damage to jobs and economic growth, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) said in a comprehensive report published on Tuesday.A decade after Brexit, Ireland’s output would be 2.6%, 4.8% or 5% lower than if Britain had stayed in the EU, it said, painting a stark picture as policymakers in Dublin try to grapple with a possibly imminent blow.A disorderly no-deal Brexit would mean 80,000 fewer jobs being created in Ireland over a decade, derailing the government’s budget planning, said the thinktank, which works closely with the Department of Finance.If Britain departed with a deal – the most benign scenario – 45,000 fewer jobs would be created, it found.Damage from a managed no-deal departure, a third scenario, would lie between those extremes.Both no-deal scenarios envisage sterling dropping around 7% against the euro over a decade, leading to higher import prices for consumers.“The impact of each Brexit scenario is considerable and will have negative effects throughout the economy on the household sector, the labour market, firms and the public finances,” said the report’s lead author, Adele Bergin.“Overall, in each scenario, the level of Irish output is permanently below where it otherwise would have been were the UK to decide to remain in the EU. However, the negative impact on Irish output in the long run in the deal scenario is approximately half that of the no-deal scenario.”The report will fuel alarm in Dublin.“As every day passes, no-deal does become more likely,” Leo Varadkar, the prime minister, said on Monday. “So we’re intensifying our no-deal preparations. They have been very much under way now for months, if not years. They are being intensified and finalised at the moment. We need to see now what happens in Westminster over the next couple of days and weeks and we’ll take it from there.”With Westminster in flux over the fate of Brexit, some Irish officials say Dublin’s projected image of readiness belies deep anxiety verging on dread about what may unfold.Ireland exports €4.5bn (£3.8bn) worth of food and drink a year to the UK, ranging from beef to cheddar cheese. It imports €33bn (£28bn) worth of products from the UK – more than China – leaving Irish consumers and companies vulnerable to disruption.Opposition parties have broadly supported Varadkar’s Brexit strategy but are preparing to pounce if a shock hits.Michael McGrath, a finance spokesperson for the main opposition party Fianna Fáil, said the ESRI report exposed the “folly” of Varadkar recently promising tax cuts.“This was an irresponsible promise to make in light of the deep uncertainty facing our country at this time as a result of Brexit … the key point is that the estimated impact on Ireland is worse than was previously thought.”Katie Daughen, the head of Brexit policy for the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, said big companies had the resources to prepare for Brexit and small companies had the nimbleness to respond to whatever happened, but medium-sized companies were vulnerable.The agri-food sector and importers who depended on raw materials from the UK were especially exposed, she said.The weakened pound is already affecting tourism.

Last week, May’s government held lengthy talks with senior MPs in the party, including Jeffrey Donaldson and Nigel Dodds.DUP leaders have been unimpressed with the way May and her team have negotiated with the EU, and believe they will have to be closely involved if the government is to leave with a deal that keeps Northern Ireland closely aligned with Britain.In a telephone call, Foster told the prime minister she would not change her party’s stance, which is to vote against the deal, if as expected it comes before the House of Commons this week. “The position remains unchanged,” a DUP source said.Hours later, May said the lack of a functioning devolved government in Stormont – suspended two years ago following a row between the DUP and Sinn Féin – made it difficult to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.“I am conscious of my duties as prime minister to all parts of our United Kingdom and of the damage to that union leaving without a deal could do when one part of it is without devolved government and unable therefore to prepare properly,” she said.Dodds, the DUP’s leader in Westminster, replied by criticising May’s “fundamental lack of preparation” for Brexit.“The prime minister has known for some considerable time, and so has the house, that 29 March was the target date, so why haven’t appropriate preparations been made?“This is a fundamental lack of preparation and the government’s entirely responsible for that, if that’s the case,” he said.Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman, accused May of using the Irish border as an excuse for failing to deliver Brexit.“When are you going to stop using Northern Ireland as an excuse? And do you realise that the importance of this agreement to delivering Brexit, and also to the union of the United Kingdom, is such that we will not be used in a scare tactic to push this through?” he said.DUP figures are already turning their thoughts to the next confidence and supply agreement, which will be raised by the party over the next two months. May’s government is highly dependent on the 10 votes of the DUP.An informed source said: “Confidence and supply two is nearly upon us. It’s almost two years, so we’ll have to work on it. We aren’t in a coalition, but it’s pretty close. If anything, C&S2 will have to be even tighter than C&S1. Not talking about putting people in cabinet or anything like that, but deeply involved in every decision, especially on Brexit.”The party negotiated £1bn in spending for Northern Ireland as part of a first confidence and supply agreement with the Tories in 2017 – giving the government a working majority.Claims of splits in the DUP over whether to support May’s deal have been denied by the party. A DUP spokesman said: “The party is focused on securing a way forward as we exit the EU which respects the referendum result and protects the Union. Confidence and supply discussions are for another time.”",DUP rejects Theresa May's personal plea to support her deal,2019-03-25/17:37:57+0000,theresa may s hopes that she can force her withdrawal deal through parliament faded on monday after the democratic unionist party leader arlene foster rejected a personal plea for support the prime minister then enraged the pro leave party further by implying that preparations for a no deal brexit on the issue of the irish border had not progressed because the northern ireland assembly had been suspended support from the dup is critical to may s hopes of getting parliament to approve her brexit plan last week may s government held lengthy talks with senior mps in the party including jeffrey donaldson and nigel dodds dup leaders have been unimpressed with the way may and her team have negotiated with the eu and believe they will have to be closely involved if the government is to leave with a deal that keeps northern ireland closely aligned with britain in a telephone call foster told the prime minister she would not change her party s stance which is to vote against the deal if as expected it comes before the house of commons this week the position remains unchanged a dup source said hours later may said the lack of a functioning devolved government in stormont suspended two years ago following a row between the dup and sinn féin made it difficult to prepare for a no deal brexit i am conscious of my duties as prime minister to all parts of our united kingdom and of the damage to that union leaving without a deal could do when one part of it is without devolved government and unable therefore to prepare properly she said dodds the dup s leader in westminster replied by criticising may s fundamental lack of preparation for brexit the prime minister has known for some considerable time and so has the house that  march was the target date so why haven t appropriate preparations been made this is a fundamental lack of preparation and the government s entirely responsible for that if that s the case he said sammy wilson the dup s brexit spokesman accused may of using the irish border as an excuse for failing to deliver brexit when are you going to stop using northern ireland as an excuse and do you realise that the importance of this agreement to delivering brexit and also to the union of the united kingdom is such that we will not be used in a scare tactic to push this through he said dup figures are already turning their thoughts to the next confidence and supply agreement which will be raised by the party over the next two months may s government is highly dependent on the  votes of the dup an informed source said confidence and supply two is nearly upon us it s almost two years so we ll have to work on it we aren t in a coalition but it s pretty close if anything c s will have to be even tighter than c s not talking about putting people in cabinet or anything like that but deeply involved in every decision especially on brexit the party negotiated bn in spending for northern ireland as part of a first confidence and supply agreement with the tories in  giving the government a working majority claims of splits in the dup over whether to support may s deal have been denied by the party a dup spokesman said the party is focused on securing a way forward as we exit the eu which respects the referendum result and protects the union confidence and supply discussions are for another time ,Brexit,0.2742083966732025
3404,"European media covered Saturday’s mammoth anti-Brexit demonstration in London with ill-concealed relish, before turning to reports of Theresa May’s imminent departure – and, in some cases, a first draft of her political obituary.“Historic demonstration in London for a second vote,” was Le Monde’s headline, above an extensive report from its London correspondent noting that more than a million people had taken to the streets “in a country where protest is not the norm”.The paper praised the crowd as “calm but determined, a sea of European blue … with not a single policeman in sight, but not a single incident either”. Compared with previous anti-Brexit marches, this one, it said, was “rather more about the failings of Theresa May’s government, and rather less about Europe”.Libération, too, noted the “peaceful and good-natured” mood. “And what if, after all, life was simpler than Brexit?” the paper asked. “What if it was a poster that made thousands laugh, a picnic on a crowded patch of grass, dogs and babies draped in European flags, and a carnival atmosphere on a Saturday in spring?”But beneath the joyful surface, it said, flowed “altogether more sinister currents”, with conservative commentators talking of a betrayal of democracy, MPs unable to go home for the weekend because of fears for their safety, and the woman responsible for the online petition to revoke article 50 also facing death threats.Germany’s Die Zeit said the demonstration’s timing was perfect, coming as it did “at the end of one of the most dramatic weeks in British politics in many years … May’s negotiations with the EU have failed, she has lost control of the Brexit process, and the danger of a no-deal Brexit looms”.The paper highlighted a recent YouGov poll indicating support for Brexit was falling even among leave voters, said the UK economy was “already experiencing difficulties”, and suggested “chaotic scenes during MPs’ Brexit debates have finally robbed many voters of all confidence that the government has things under control”.Like many European papers, De Volkskrant in the Netherlands picked up UK reports that May was in difficulty. “It is, as far as her ministers are concerned, no longer a question of whether she should go, but when,” the paper said. “Under her, Downing Street has become a bunker.”The paper said May “lacks the communication skills, the capacity for creative thinking and the political flexibility to make a success of Brexit”.It added: “She speaks mostly in platitudes: ‘Brexit means Brexit’, ‘strong and stable’, ‘smooth and orderly’.”But above all, the paper concluded: “Brexit was, for her, a way to control immigration. This was a red line that ruled out other options in the negotiations and led, inevitably, to the present impasse.”Spain’s El País said Britain’s politicians had “still not found a solution to Brexit, almost three years after the referendum”, prompting hundreds of thousands to take to the streets in London to protest “against Brexit, the failure of MPs to reach a decision and, mainly, to demand a new referendum”.The paper translated – with contextual notes where needed – the march’s 20 best placards, from “Even Arsenal are still in Europe” through “Pulling out doesn’t work – just ask my parents” and “Less Farage, more fromage” to “I’m incandescent with rage – but I’m British, so I’m just holding up a sign”.Reports of the UK’s meltdown reached well beyond Europe, with the press in Venezuela – itself hardly a stranger to political chaos – also covering Saturday’s Put it to the People march extensively in its Sunday editions.",European media delight in covering anti-Brexit march,2019-03-24/18:00:11+0000,european media covered saturday s mammoth anti brexit demonstration in london with ill concealed relish before turning to reports of theresa may s imminent departure and in some cases a first draft of her political obituary historic demonstration in london for a second vote was le monde s headline above an extensive report from its london correspondent noting that more than a million people had taken to the streets in a country where protest is not the norm the paper praised the crowd as calm but determined a sea of european blue with not a single policeman in sight but not a single incident either compared with previous anti brexit marches this one it said was rather more about the failings of theresa may s government and rather less about europe libération too noted the peaceful and good natured mood and what if after all life was simpler than brexit the paper asked what if it was a poster that made thousands laugh a picnic on a crowded patch of grass dogs and babies draped in european flags and a carnival atmosphere on a saturday in spring but beneath the joyful surface it said flowed altogether more sinister currents with conservative commentators talking of a betrayal of democracy mps unable to go home for the weekend because of fears for their safety and the woman responsible for the online petition to revoke article  also facing death threats germany s die zeit said the demonstration s timing was perfect coming as it did at the end of one of the most dramatic weeks in british politics in many years may s negotiations with the eu have failed she has lost control of the brexit process and the danger of a no deal brexit looms the paper highlighted a recent yougov poll indicating support for brexit was falling even among leave voters said the uk economy was already experiencing difficulties and suggested chaotic scenes during mps brexit debates have finally robbed many voters of all confidence that the government has things under control like many european papers de volkskrant in the netherlands picked up uk reports that may was in difficulty it is as far as her ministers are concerned no longer a question of whether she should go but when the paper said under her downing street has become a bunker the paper said may lacks the communication skills the capacity for creative thinking and the political flexibility to make a success of brexit it added she speaks mostly in platitudes brexit means brexit strong and stable smooth and orderly but above all the paper concluded brexit was for her a way to control immigration this was a red line that ruled out other options in the negotiations and led inevitably to the present impasse spain s el país said britain s politicians had still not found a solution to brexit almost three years after the referendum prompting hundreds of thousands to take to the streets in london to protest against brexit the failure of mps to reach a decision and mainly to demand a new referendum the paper translated with contextual notes where needed the march s  best placards from even arsenal are still in europe through pulling out doesn t work just ask my parents and less farage more fromage to i m incandescent with rage but i m british so i m just holding up a sign reports of the uk s meltdown reached well beyond europe with the press in venezuela itself hardly a stranger to political chaos also covering saturday s put it to the people march extensively in its sunday editions ,Brexit,0.1943758726119995
3431,"‘You want this Brexit process to be over and done with.” Last Wednesday, Theresa May presumed to speak for the whole nation in a catastrophically judged TV address to the public. Yet, as Britain teeters on the edge of crashing out of the EU without a deal, which would surely be the worst national disaster since the Second World War, the disconnect between voters and the actions being taken in their name has perhaps never been greater. Just 14% of voters say they think the deal the prime minister is trying to ram through parliament delivers the type of Brexit people voted for in 2016.It is this yawning gulf between public sentiment and government action that propelled more than a million people from all over the country to take to the streets of the capital today in a compelling demonstration of disdain for the prime minister’s tactics and support for a popular vote on the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU. Critics have accused the protesters of staging a last-ditch attempt to overturn the result of the referendum. But the historic march represents something far more significant: the growing number of voters unwilling to allow politicians in thrall to ideological obsessions or narrow party interests to use an ill-defined and chimerical notion of the “will of the people” to drive through divisive and potentially catastrophic agendas.Theresa May has consistently sowed division where she should have tried to generate national consensusThe marchers have made their voices heard. They must be heeded. The initiative now passes to parliament. Will MPs heed the reminder that more than 16 million people voted to remain in the EU in 2016 and that the most important job of government in the wake of a narrow victory for Leave was to try to forge a path that healed a divided country?May has consistently sowed division where she should have tried to generate national consensus. She has pursued a Brexit strategy designed first and foremost to keep the Conservative party unified and her premiership secure, the national interest barely an afterthought. And she has ridden roughshod over parliament at every turn: resisting giving it a say over triggering article 50; granting a meaningful vote on her deal only when compelled to do so; attempting to force MPs into voting for her deal by delaying vote after vote to take us closer to the cliff edge.May’s televised address last week was the culmination of that strategy. “I am on your side,” she intoned to voters. “Parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice.” She embraced populist language that could have been uttered by any tinpot dictator looking to trample the democratic institutions frustrating their personal agenda. In our parliamentary democracy, May’s mandate to lead the country comes purely from any support she commands from the House of Commons. Her words were not only self-defeating but bordering on the dangerously unconstitutional.The 2016 referendum established nothing more than that there was a narrow majority of voters in favour of leaving the EU. No concrete plan for leaving the EU was presented during the campaign; on the contrary, it was characterised by contradictory claims and a denial that Brexit would involve trade-offs. Yet May invented a mandate that would bolster Tory unity, adopting red lines on scrapping freedom of movement and leaving the customs union that reflected her party’s Eurosceptic flank rather than public sentiment. In a citizens’ assembly, run by University College London’s constitution unit in 2017, whose members were demographically representative of the UK and of the Leave-Remain split, 70% were in favour of maintaining freedom of movement by the end of the deliberative process, so long as the UK made full use of existing controls. The real impetus for May’s Brexit comes not from the “will of the people” but from the hard right of the Conservative party.Labour’s position on Brexit has been no less parochial. Jeremy Corbyn has sought to maintain an ambiguous position on Brexit for as long as possible, ignoring the views of a huge proportion of his party members. He has failed to capitalise on May’s weaknesses to provide the leadership Britain so desperately needs. Both parties are riven by Brexit divides, rendering the political system helpless to respond to the crisis engulfing Westminster.Even though parliament had expressed its opposition to leaving on Friday without a deal, this looked distinctly possible as a result of the dangerous political stasis that had set in. But at the 11th hour, the EU granted a reprieve, postponing the Leave date by two weeks to 12 April, the cutoff for the UK notifying the EU it will take part in this year’s European elections. May has until then to get her deal through. If not, we must either request a longer extension, contingent on taking part in European elections, or leave without a deal.The calls for May to resign from within her own party have increased in intensity this weekend. But this would achieve nothing save plunging the Conservative party into a leadership contest and the country into even deeper crisis. The only way forward is for parliament to wrest control from the government this week and hold a series of indicative votes to try to establish which route commands most support in the Commons.The only way forward is for parliament to wrest control from the government and hold a series of indicative votesSeveral MPs have been advocating a Norway-plus type deal. This is certainly the least bad form of Brexit, although it would significantly reduce the UK’s influence over the laws and rules with which it would need to continue to comply. But a major question mark hanging over this proposal is whether the cross-party coalition in favour of Norway-plus could be sustained over the months, even years, that it would take to negotiate. There will be no agreement about the UK’s future relationship until after Brexit. A soft-Brexit coalition of MPs could risk handing a blank cheque to any future prime minister to negotiate whatever agreement they see fit and present this versus no deal to MPs at the end of the transition phase.The best option by far remains a referendum on May’s withdrawal deal versus the status quo. The 2016 referendum put no concrete proposal to leave the EU on the table and it would be unthinkable to leave without asking voters to ratify the terms of our exit. If voters choose to support May’s deal, Brexit must be followed by a national conversation about the UK’s future relationship with the EU, informed by a national citizens’ assembly.May has shown, time and again, that she is on the side of whatever she believes best binds the Conservative party together. It is entirely conceivable that, in the event of her deal being voted down again, she ignores parliament and opts for no deal to secure her legacy as the prime minister who delivered Brexit. On Saturday, Britons turned out in their many hundreds of thousands to deliver their judgment of the strategy of May’s government so far.

3435,"Calls for a public inquiry into Brexit are mounting among diplomats, business figures, peers and MPs, amid claims that the civil service is already planning for a future investigation into how it has been handled.The decision to call the referendum, the red lines drawn up by Theresa May and Britain’s negotiating strategy are all issues that senior figures would like to be examined.Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said an inquiry was needed into “the biggest humiliation since Suez, certainly since the IMF crisis [in 1976]”. The cross-party peer said he believed the civil service “is both expecting and preparing for this”.“We do need to understand how on earth we ended up where we have and it probably needs to go back to the decisions around holding a referendum and the way the question was framed,” he said. “It would need to be a public inquiry, probably judge-led.”Peter Ricketts, the former national security adviser and former head civil servant in the Foreign Office, cited the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war. “Chilcot took a long time, but it was cathartic,” he said. “The report was widely seen to have done the job and I think you can say the British system is better for it. I think the handling of Brexit has been such a failure of the process of government, with such wide ramifications, that there needs to be a searching public inquiry.“What advice was given to ministers? Was it taken? Did the processes of collective cabinet decision-taking work? Were the right skills available, for example on no-deal planning and all the costs involved? They are all legitimate questions for an inquiry. It should have the powers of a judicial inquiry.”One senior Tory peer said: “We want our Chilcot.”Sir Mike Rake, the former chair of BT, said: “When the dust has settled, there really should be some kind of public inquiry, looking at both the issues around holding a referendum and the context of what has happened in terms of pursuing Brexit.”Many figures are already pointing to May’s early decision to set out strict red lines that seriously limited Britain’s ability to negotiate. John Kerr, Britain’s former EU ambassador who drafted the article 50 process of leaving the bloc, said: “Those red lines laid down in 2016 emerged with no consultation with the country, the devolved assemblies, parliament or with the cabinet. Then there was the decision to trigger article, 50 still with no agreement in cabinet of where we wanted to end up.”Sir Jonathan Faull, a former senior EU official, said: “It would be surprising if the events relating to UK withdrawal from the EU were not the subject of one or more inquiries. An important initial question will be when to start. The 2015 election? The 2016 referendum? The article 50 notification? The scope ranges from Whitehall and Westminster to Belfast, Brussels and beyond.”There is also support in the Commons. Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “The government’s handling of Brexit has been a shambles from start to finish. It was a dereliction of duty to allow the country to get to this point, days before Brexit, in danger of crashing out with no deal or trying to force parliament to accept a deal it’s already rejected twice.

The best outcome now would be a long delay, and it’s not the worst thing in the world to ask people to vote for some MEPs, and certainly better than stockpiling medicine and turning Kent into a car park. “So I think the best outcome is a long delay where we rethink how we deliver on the referendum result and we try and find a majority for a compromise Brexit agreement and possibly have a second referendum.”Osborne was asked about calling Theresa May a “dead woman walking”, to which he said: “After that election she called [in 2017] … I never thought she could recover authority and I said it at the moment.”The education minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “If parliament decides to vote down the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement, then I think it would be political meltdown and parliament would have failed.” Zahawi also said he was not prepared to tell his constituents that the UK would take part in the EU elections. “Each and every one of us will have to ask ourselves the question: ‘Am I prepared to go back to my constituents and say we’re not leaving the EU, we’re going to go for a much longer extension, and we’re going to take part in the European elections?’ I’m not prepared to do that. I don’t think the prime minister is prepared to do that.”The comments came as hundreds of thousands of people head to London on Saturday to march on parliament calling for the public to be given a final say on Brexit. Protesters will travel from all over the UK and further afield for the People’s Vote campaign’s Put it to the People march, after a similar rally in October drew crowds of 700,000.

3456,"Britain is “dangerously close to the full-scale disaster” of a no-deal Brexit, Sir Richard Branson has claimed in an open letter, accusing Theresa May of acting against the national interest.The Virgin tycoon, who is not resident in the UK for tax purposes, said the economy had already sustained damage as a result of Brexit, and said a no-deal scenario would trigger a “multi-generational disaster”.He called for a public vote giving people the chance to choose between a range of options on what the UK’s future relationship with the EU should be.“This is a moment of profound national crisis for the UK,” said the billionaire, who was revealed in 2016 to be helping fund a group fighting to stop Brexit.“Prioritising party over country, the prime minister is no longer acting in the national interest. Instead, she has decided to pitch herself as the defender of the ‘people’ against the machinations of parliament,” Branson wrote. “By limiting the MPs’ choice yet again to one between her own deal and no deal at all, she is placing a dangerous bet.” Branson, who is worth £4.5bn thanks to his investments in air, rail, finance and leisure, said preparations for Brexit and the uncertainty around what form it would take had already cost the economy “billions”.“Thousands of jobs in Britain have been lost already, with many more redundancies on the horizon as manufacturers react to the looming threat of tariffs and supply chain disruptions,” he said.“More than a trillion pounds in assets are being moved to Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris, and other European cities as financial institutions begin to execute their contingency plans. And Brexit preparations alone have eaten up billions that could have been spent elsewhere.“These consequences are real and tangible. They affect people everywhere across the UK. They affect investment in the UK, the nation’s ability to trade goods and services, to travel, to jointly tackle global challenges, from climate change to terrorism.”He said the British electorate should be given a final say on Brexit, with all options left on the table, because their views might have changed since the referendum.Branson said if people were not given a final say, the government should revoke article 50 and restart the Brexit process.“There is little time to avoid a multi-generational disaster,” he concluded.",Richard Branson fears 'full-scale disaster' of no-deal Brexit,2019-03-22/15:53:44+0000,britain is dangerously close to the full scale disaster of a no deal brexit sir richard branson has claimed in an open letter accusing theresa may of acting against the national interest the virgin tycoon who is not resident in the uk for tax purposes said the economy had already sustained damage as a result of brexit and said a no deal scenario would trigger a multi generational disaster he called for a public vote giving people the chance to choose between a range of options on what the uk s future relationship with the eu should be this is a moment of profound national crisis for the uk said the billionaire who was revealed in  to be helping fund a group fighting to stop brexit prioritising party over country the prime minister is no longer acting in the national interest instead she has decided to pitch herself as the defender of the people against the machinations of parliament branson wrote by limiting the mps choice yet again to one between her own deal and no deal at all she is placing a dangerous bet branson who is worth  bn thanks to his investments in air rail finance and leisure said preparations for brexit and the uncertainty around what form it would take had already cost the economy billions thousands of jobs in britain have been lost already with many more redundancies on the horizon as manufacturers react to the looming threat of tariffs and supply chain disruptions he said more than a trillion pounds in assets are being moved to dublin frankfurt paris and other european cities as financial institutions begin to execute their contingency plans and brexit preparations alone have eaten up billions that could have been spent elsewhere these consequences are real and tangible they affect people everywhere across the uk they affect investment in the uk the nation s ability to trade goods and services to travel to jointly tackle global challenges from climate change to terrorism he said the british electorate should be given a final say on brexit with all options left on the table because their views might have changed since the referendum branson said if people were not given a final say the government should revoke article  and restart the brexit process there is little time to avoid a multi generational disaster he concluded ,Brexit,0.19746828079223633
3547,"A work-to-rule strike by French customs officers warning they are not ready for Brexit is likely to stretch into next week and cause further chaos on Eurostar trains and channel ports.At Gare du Nord in Paris on Wednesday, hundreds of passengers queued in lines stretching the full length of the station, with an estimated six-hour wait for trains to the UK. Eurostar has encouraged people not to travel at all between Paris and London this week if they could avoid it.French customs officers are into their third week of industrial action over long-running anger at working conditions, saying a lack of preparation for a no-deal Brexit was the final straw.Instead of walking off the job, customs officers are diligently carrying out longer and more rigorous checks than usual, to demonstrate what might happen if full border controls are put in place after Brexit, particularly in the case of no deal.Union leaders said customs officers at the Eurostar terminal were simply asking two or three extra questions of passengers – which was causing acute delays and train cancellations.When the action began at Calais and Dunkirk ports on 4 March, customs officers simply carried out vehicle checks and requested registration documents, resulting in two weeks of lengthy tailbacks for trucks waiting to cross to Britain. Unions warned the disturbance caused by rigorous checks was a taste of post-Brexit reality.Vincent Thomazo, secretary general of the customs branch of the Unsa union, told the Guardian: “This strike is over long-running concerns over our general working conditions, but Brexit was the final straw. We believe that contingency plans here for Brexit are low-cost, with not enough extra customs officers. Brexit has highlighted a sense of angst that had been there for years.”Of a no-deal Brexit, Thomazo said: “We are absolutely not ready – no one is. Everyone is in denial.”The French government insists it is ready for a no-deal Brexit, with the recruitment of an extra 700 customs officials. Unions say more are needed.Last week French unions representing around 17,000 customs workers rejected a government offer of a €14m payroll boost, saying it was insufficient. No new talks are scheduled, and the joint industrial action by all unions is open-ended.In the Eurostar queue at Gare du Nord, Ashley Barnes and Zach Mance from Portland, Oregon, were bracing for a six-hour wait. The US couple had deliberately booked their honeymoon trip between Amsterdam, Paris and London before the Brexit exit date of 29 March to avoid travel chaos.“We thought since we’d be there before Brexit, it would be fine,” said Barnes. Mance, who works for a small winery in the US, had – like many in the queue – brought a bottle of wine to share for the wait.Keith Howell from Essex, who used to work in banking, and Helen Aslett, who works for a small firm in Braintree, had worried more about the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protest in Paris when booking their trip. They had rushed to visit Montmartre and the Moulin Rouge in the morning before dedicating almost a full day to queuing. They had voted to remain in the Brexit referendum. “I didn’t think we had enough information or knowledge to vote leave,” Howell said. “But we had been told an exit would be orderly, instead there is complete uncertainty.”“Even more reason to get away from France!” said Nick, 64, a retired healthworker from Essex. He had voted to leave the EU but feared if Brexit was postponed it might never happen. His partner, celebrating her birthday with a three-day trip to Paris, had voted remain, “because I feared that leaving would be a mess”.

3570,"Two hundred coaches have been booked to take people to London for a People’s Vote march, which organisers said would exceed the size of last October’s rally, when it was claimed 700,000 turned up.James McGrory, the director of the People’s Vote campaign, said it was the “biggest mass movement in the country” and hundreds of thousands were expected to join the march from Park Lane to Parliament Square.The campaign group claimed the number of coaches booked was more than double the number in October, although the exact figure is understood to be slightly less as 105 coaches brought people to the capital last autumn.Details emerged at a People’s Vote event aimed largely at foreign journalists, where the campaign admitted that despite the preparations for the weekend, there was still no immediate prospect of MPs voting for a second referendum.Protesters would come from places that voted heavily to leave the EU, McGrory said, including from Chesterfield, Doncaster, Lincoln and Peterborough. A coach from the Scottish Highlands will leave on Friday evening, and another from Penzance in Cornwall will leave at 3.15am.The claim of 700,000 attendees in October made it the second largest march in the UK this century, after the 2003 Stop the War demonstration, although other estimates suggested the figure was about 450,000.McGrory and other People’s Vote insiders declined to predict how many would turn up on Saturday, warning the weather would be a determining factor, but the numbers of people pre-registering on the campaign website were “significantly higher” than before.Alastair Campbell, the former Labour press chief and People’s Vote campaigner, conceded that despite the current Brexit crisis, “if there was a vote [in the Commons] tomorrow on a people’s vote it would not win”.Last week, when a second referendum was put before the Commons it was voted down 334 to 85, with the majority of the Labour party abstaining and the People’s Vote campaign arguing it was not the right time to press the issue to the vote.Campbell said the decision to abstain was a “tactical judgment”, reflecting the fact the proposal was not likely to pass even with Labour support.The march is due to begin at noon at the north end of Park Lane near Marble Arch and end at Parliament Square, with speeches from 2.45pm. Speakers from all parties are due to be announced shortly. There will be an additional relay to large screens in Trafalgar Square to help spread out the crowds.The leftwing anti-Brexit group Another Europe is Possible is holding a rally just before the march on Saturday, asking people to assemble at 11am at Stanhope Gate in central London. It will begin with speeches from Labour MPs including Clive Lewis, Kate Osamor and Lloyd-Russell Moyle as well the Green party joint leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley.The campaign also released YouGov polling that showed, according to Peter Kellner, a former president of the data company, that British public opinion was “polarising around Brexit”. The research said a referendum between staying in the EU and May’s Brexit deal would see remain win 60% to 40% – and that remain would defeat no deal by 56% to 44%.But it also showed that the public believed that a no-deal Brexit would honour the result of the 2016 referendum by 46% to 31%, and that softer Brexit deals in which the UK still followed EU rules and regulations would not honour the result by 68% to 11%.A slight majority of the public, 52%, wanted Brexit delayed, while 35% said the UK should leave next week come what may. But only 10% said a delay should be used to give May’s Brexit deal more time to pass; others said it should be used to negotiate a soft Brexit, hold a general election or have a second referendum.","People's Vote march: 200 coaches heading to London, organisers say",2019-03-20/13:37:51+0000,two hundred coaches have been booked to take people to london for a people s vote march which organisers said would exceed the size of last october s rally when it was claimed   turned up james mcgrory the director of the people s vote campaign said it was the biggest mass movement in the country and hundreds of thousands were expected to join the march from park lane to parliament square the campaign group claimed the number of coaches booked was more than double the number in october although the exact figure is understood to be slightly less as  coaches brought people to the capital last autumn details emerged at a people s vote event aimed largely at foreign journalists where the campaign admitted that despite the preparations for the weekend there was still no immediate prospect of mps voting for a second referendum protesters would come from places that voted heavily to leave the eu mcgrory said including from chesterfield doncaster lincoln and peterborough a coach from the scottish highlands will leave on friday evening and another from penzance in cornwall will leave at  am the claim of   attendees in october made it the second largest march in the uk this century after the  stop the war demonstration although other estimates suggested the figure was about   mcgrory and other people s vote insiders declined to predict how many would turn up on saturday warning the weather would be a determining factor but the numbers of people pre registering on the campaign website were significantly higher than before alastair campbell the former labour press chief and people s vote campaigner conceded that despite the current brexit crisis if there was a vote in the commons tomorrow on a people s vote it would not win last week when a second referendum was put before the commons it was voted down  to  with the majority of the labour party abstaining and the people s vote campaign arguing it was not the right time to press the issue to the vote campbell said the decision to abstain was a tactical judgment reflecting the fact the proposal was not likely to pass even with labour support the march is due to begin at noon at the north end of park lane near marble arch and end at parliament square with speeches from  pm speakers from all parties are due to be announced shortly there will be an additional relay to large screens in trafalgar square to help spread out the crowds the leftwing anti brexit group another europe is possible is holding a rally just before the march on saturday asking people to assemble at am at stanhope gate in central london it will begin with speeches from labour mps including clive lewis kate osamor and lloyd russell moyle as well the green party joint leaders sian berry and jonathan bartley the campaign also released yougov polling that showed according to peter kellner a former president of the data company that british public opinion was polarising around brexit the research said a referendum between staying in the eu and may s brexit deal would see remain win  to  and that remain would defeat no deal by  to  but it also showed that the public believed that a no deal brexit would honour the result of the  referendum by  to  and that softer brexit deals in which the uk still followed eu rules and regulations would not honour the result by  to  a slight majority of the public  wanted brexit delayed while  said the uk should leave next week come what may but only  said a delay should be used to give may s brexit deal more time to pass others said it should be used to negotiate a soft brexit hold a general election or have a second referendum ,Brexit,0.1837724894285202
3702,"Dublin port is putting the finishing touches to new customs booths and freight inspection points in preparation for Brexit, but there will not be any ribbon-cutting ceremony when – or if – they open.“Bloody border posts. It’s a waste of money, a waste of time and a waste of space,” said the port company’s chief executive, Eamonn O’Reilly, as he toured the docks recently.New infrastructure is usually a source of pride here, a sign that the gateway to Ireland’s economy is expanding, but O’Reilly winced at the sight of the parking bays, canopies and warehouse earmarked for trucks from Britain.“It’s a complete pain in the ...” – he fished for a diplomatic word – “in the port”.The port has spent €30m (£25.5m) and set aside 7.8 hectares (19 acres) in preparation for Britain crashing out of the EU on 29 March, a day that now looks set to be delayed or even cancelled, leaving the border posts idle or redundant. Yet O’Reilly felt compelled to prepare, just in case.“I’ve given up trying to double-guess what might happen. What happens day by day in Westminster is just extraordinary.”Should Theresa May squeak her deal through parliament in her third attempt this week, the state-owned port’s border posts may end up as 21st-century versions of the Martello towers, a chain of small forts around Dublin Bay built to repel a Napoleonic invasion that never came.Should no deal materialise, the port’s preparations will face a mammoth test that will shape Ireland’s post-Brexit fate.Almost 90% of Ireland’s road freight traffic passes through the port, an economic chokepoint that has been overshadowed by focus on the backstop and border with Northern Ireland.Food, medicine, clothes, machinery, horses and other goods and livestock come via Holyhead in north Wales, Liverpool and Heysham in Lancashire. The equivalent of 13km |(eight miles) of trucks and containers is offloaded in less than an hour before dawn, one of four “waves” of vessels that dock daily, said O’Reilly. “A line of steel just pouring off the ships.”About 200,000 of the 1.3m containers that enter the port each year originate outside the EU and require customs checks. Should the UK crash out, that 200,000 will rise to 1m – requiring a significant diversion of resources for a port that is growing fast and utilises land, in terms of tonnes per hectare, almost twice as intensively as Rotterdam.Hundreds of newly recruited or assigned revenue officers, gardai, customs inspectors, vets and other officials are on standby, part of the Irish government’s attempt to “Brexit-proof” the economy.“I’m old enough to remember when customs posts were taken down,” said O’Reilly, a reference to the early 1990s when the EU single market was created.Brexit has renewed his appreciation for that “massive achievement”, a frictionless wonder facilitated by the EU handling trade rules and myriad red tape. “Air travel, roaming charges, environmental standards – we take it for granted.”O’Reilly, who has hosted British and Irish ministers at the port, is confident that under no deal goods would keep flowing, albeit more slowly. “Dublin port will have the infrastructure ready. I don’t think state services will be fully manned up. It’s unreasonable to expect that Ireland or any country would be completely manned up at the outset.” Staffing would expand as needed, he said.Asked if he was personally stockpiling anything, he shook his head. Not all share O’Reilly’s confidence.John McGrane, the director general of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, speaking on the sidelines of a Brexit conference at the National University of Ireland in Galway, predicted significant delays for ships and trucks and disruption of supply chains.“It’s a fantasy to think that in a hard Brexit context what the ports are doing will be adequate to avoid disruption,” he said. McGrane worried especially about the import of raw materials and the fate of mid-sized agri-food companies.The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has warned Ireland that no country can be fully prepared for no deal. “It is uncharted territory. No country has ever left the EU before.”Some Brexiters reportedly hoped the prospect of gridlock and disruption in Dublin and elsewhere would prompt Irish businesses to pressure Varadkar to compromise on the backstop, the insurance policy to avert a hard border with Northern Ireland that has bedevilled the Brexit deal.That has not happened.

3734,"Politicians will move heaven and earth to prevent the country leaving the EU with no deal, John McDonnell has said, adding that such an outcome would be catastrophic for the economy.Speaking before an event in Gravesend, Kent, the shadow chancellor also indicated that Labour might support a compromise proposed by two of the party’s MPs which would see Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement put to a public vote after being passed in the House of Commons.McDonnell criticised the prime minister’s parliamentary tactics this week, particularly her emphasis on the legal default of the UK leaving without a deal on 29 March.“I think that’s irritated MPs so much, that’s why no deal was voted out, and I know that was only an advisory motion but I think MPs would move heaven and earth to prevent no deal if she tried that again,” he said.“People have looked over the edge, they’ve taken the advice of Theresa May’s own Treasury department, they’ve taken the advice of the Bank of England, every independent assessment of the consequence of no deal, which is pretty catastrophic for our economy.”He confirmed the party leadership would back the amendment giving the UK the final say on any deal that is eventually passed by parliament.“We are working with Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, they have their amendment, which was about going back to the people with whatever was agreed in parliament,” he said. “So we’ve said we would support that if it comes back, and it may well be this week but it will be down to the tactics they want to pursue, because they will only push that when they think they’ve got a realistic prospect of winning.”McDonnell cautioned against accepting the current withdrawal agreement, saying that it wasn’t credible and would cause economic harm.“There’s no point putting Theresa May’s deal or something like that, in my view because it’s not credible, it’s dangerous. It has to be a credible deal that we think would protect jobs and the economy, and I think that’s what a majority of MPs would vote for. I don’t think a majority would vote for something that would damage their constituents’ livelihoods.”A referendum on whatever deal emerges could take place in a “relatively curtailed period of time”, he said, although the Electoral Commission has said that it could take months to organise the campaign and the vote.Whatever deal is agreed would have to be realistic enough to convince the EU that delaying the UK’s exit from it was acceptable, McDonnell said.Labour whipped its MPs to abstain on Thursday from a Commons vote that would have supported a second referendum, despite it being party policy.

3777,"Ireland will want to avoid a series of “rolling cliff edges” if the UK requests a delay to its exit from the EU, the country’s finance minister has said.Paschal Donohoe said London would need to convince the EU27 that an extension to article 50 would not further risk economic disruption.“I believe it is highly important that we do all we can to avoid being in a scenario of rolling cliff edges … particularly from a financial market stability perspective and economic stability, we need to be aware of that,” he said.Theresa May is expected to ask the EU for an extension next week at the European council summit after MPs voted overwhelming to delay Brexit until 30 June.Donohoe said the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, had made it clear that Ireland would “provide a generous response” but that London needed to spell out what it wanted from any extension.A delay of anything from a few months to as long as 21 months has been mooted in recent weeks, with some EU leaders such as the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, questioning the point of any extension if the UK was not clear about the kind of Brexit it wanted.Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, is among those who have suggested that a long extension could be helpful, despite the complications, as it could “facilitate a fundamental rethink” of the approach the UK has taken to Brexit.Donohoe told Bloomberg TV: “What is really important to us and to the European Union is that … we are all clear what that extension period is for and that the availability of that extension period doesn’t in any way heighten the kind of economic risk that we are trying to avoid at the moment.”He said Ireland was still hopeful a deal could be achieved before 29 March as originally envisaged. “The few days that are now approaching continue to be of the highest importance.”Asked if he feared a last-minute demand from EU leaders to succumb to British pressure for a time limit on the Irish backstop, he said he was confident that “the solidarity that has been shown to Ireland up to this point will continue”.Donohue rejected suggestions that Ireland would relent in the face of pressure from the farming community, which is facing a potential disaster if Britain crashes out of the bloc and imposes high tariffs on imports of meat and dairy from Ireland.“The backstop is as much an indispensable tool of our economic future as it is of our political stability,” he said. “Any change regarding the status of the border on our island would not only would have profound political consequences but would have profound economic consequences.”",Brexit delay cannot lead to 'rolling cliff edges' – Irish minister,2019-03-15/12:20:10+0000,ireland will want to avoid a series of rolling cliff edges if the uk requests a delay to its

3840,"Senior Tory Eurosceptics believe they and the Democratic Unionist party could be persuaded to back Theresa May’s Brexit deal if Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, gave clearer legal advice about how the UK could withdraw from an international treaty.It is understood the DUP is back in talks with senior government figures about what it would take for them to back May’s deal at a third Commons vote. A party source said: “Channels are open.”The majority of Eurosceptic MPs from the European Research Group (ERG) voted against May’s revised deal, defeating it for a second time, because Cox advised there was only a “reduced risk” that the UK could be trapped indefinitely in the Northern Ireland backstop and therefore a customs union with the EU.However, discussions are taking place around a point that Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG chair, raised in the House of Commons before Tuesday’s vote, relating to “how article 62 of the Vienna convention could be used”.Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, replied that the UK would have the ability to terminate the withdrawal agreement “if the facts clearly warranted that there had been an unforeseen and fundamental change of circumstances affecting the essential basis of the treaty on which the United Kingdom’s consent had been given”.He added: “It would, in the government’s view, be clear in those exceptional circumstances that international law provides the United Kingdom with a right to terminate the withdrawal agreement. In the unlikely event that that were to happen, the United Kingdom would no doubt offer to continue to observe the unexhausted obligations in connection, for example, with citizens’ rights.”An ERG source said this had been written by Cox but had not made it into the final legal advice. “If we’d had it earlier in the day it could have changed the vote,” the source said.He said not everyone in the ERG had the potential to be convinced, but many still wanted to back an improved deal rather than leave on no-deal terms. If there was some more momentum in favour of a deal, a few more Labour MPs could potentially be convinced.No 10 is still holding out hope of getting the deal passed through the Commons on a third or even fourth attempt.Earlier on Wednesday, Steve Baker, the ERG’s chief organiser, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the group had been “really yearning” to vote for a deal but Cox’s bombshell legal advice on the Northern Ireland backstop meant that was impossible.Rees-Mogg also did not rule out changing his mind on the deal in future.Speaking to the Guardian’s Today in Focus podcast, due out on Friday, Rees-Mogg said: “I think leaving without a deal is better than the prime minister’s deal as it is currently announced, though I would have preferred a deal had that proved possible and if this deal could be made more palatable I would still prefer a deal to no deal. It is not a cunning plan to get us to no deal by default.”Asked whether he would vote for the deal if the DUP were happy with it, he said: “Yes. I am a unionist but it is difficult for me to be more unionist than the DUP and if they are happy with the way of getting out of the backstop and that is good enough for Northern Ireland then I expect it would be good enough for some of us.”Asked whether he would vote for May’s deal on 28 March if it was a choice between that and losing Brexit, Rees-Mogg said: “In the words of the deceased prime minister Lord Oxford and Asquith, wait and see.”",ERG signals it could back May's Brexit deal if legal advice is clearer,2019-03-13/18:39:43+0000,senior tory eurosceptics believe they and the democratic unionist party could be persuaded to back theresa may s brexit deal if geoffrey cox the attorney general gave clearer legal advice about how the uk could withdraw from an international treaty it is understood the dup is back in talks with senior government figures about what it would take for them to back may s deal at a third commons vote a party source said channels are open the majority of eurosceptic mps from the european research group erg voted against may s revised deal defeating it for a second time because cox advised there was only a reduced risk that the uk could be trapped indefinitely in the northern ireland backstop and therefore a customs union with the eu however discussions are taking place around a point that jacob rees mogg the erg chair raised in the house of commons before tuesday s vote relating to how article  of the vienna convention could be used stephen barclay the brexit secretary replied that the uk would have the ability to terminate the withdrawal agreement if the facts clearly warranted that there had been an unforeseen and fundamental change of circumstances affecting the essential basis of the treaty on which the united kingdom s consent had been given he added it would in the government s view be clear in those exceptional circumstances that international law provides the united kingdom with a right to terminate the withdrawal agreement in the unlikely event that that were to happen the united kingdom would no doubt offer to continue to observe the unexhausted obligations in connection for example with citizens rights an erg source said this had been written by cox but had not made it into the final legal advice if we d had it earlier in the day it could have changed the vote the source said he said not everyone in the erg had the potential to be convinced but many still wanted to back an improved deal rather than leave on no deal terms if there was some more momentum in favour of a deal a few more labour mps could potentially be convinced no  is still holding out hope of getting the deal passed through the commons on a third or even fourth attempt earlier on wednesday steve baker the erg s chief organiser told bbc radio  s today programme that the group had been really yearning to vote for a deal but cox s bombshell legal advice on the northern ireland backstop meant that was impossible rees mogg also did not rule out changing his mind on the deal in future speaking to the guardian s today in focus podcast due out on friday rees mogg said i think leaving without a deal is better than the prime minister s deal as it is currently announced though i would have preferred a deal had that proved possible and if this deal could be made more palatable i would still prefer a deal to no deal it is not a cunning plan to get us to no deal by default asked whether he would vote for the deal if the dup were happy with it he said yes i am a unionist but it is difficult for me to be more unionist than the dup and if they are happy with the way of getting out of the backstop and that is good enough for northern ireland then i expect it would be good enough for some of us asked whether he would vote for may s deal on  march if it was a choice between that and losing brexit rees mogg said in the words of the deceased prime minister lord oxford and asquith wait and see ,Brexit,0.3174988329410553
3884,"Ministers have voiced concern that already stretched police resources will be diverted from Britain’s cities to help contend with any traffic and transport problems arising in Kent from a no-deal Brexit affecting the Channel ports.The plans form part of Operation Snow Bunting, which aims to coordinate the policing response to Brexit, but Whitehall sources said there was unhappiness in cabinet with the idea of diverting so many officers to the county.“I can’t believe we are planning to take officers off the street at a time knife crime is rising,” one cabinet source said, arguing that the public will start to understand the impact of a no-deal Brexit as the government finally spells out its plans.On Wednesday morning, the government will say what tariffs it will levy on food and goods, and how it will ensure the Northern Ireland border remains open – plans that had been deemed so sensitive that they had been kept secret until now.Theresa May told MPs after being defeated on her Brexit deal for a second time that ministers would publish “essential policies which would need to be put in place if we were to leave without a deal” before Wednesday’s Commons vote on allowing a no-deal Brexit on 29 March.The prime minister said Conservative MPs would be given a free vote on the issue to head off a string of frontbench resignations. Cabinet members are expected to be split, with Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd and Greg Clark opposed to no deal and Liam Fox, Chris Grayling and Penny Mordaunt among those who could be in favour.Kent police confirmed that they had requested more officers in the event of no deal, using an existing mutual aid system, but the force would not say how many officers it would need to ensure traffic kept moving.Kent county council has drawn up plans to park 5,000 lorries on one lane of the M20, nearby dual carriageways and a further 6,000 at Manston airport if there are delays at the Channel ports.But Paul Carter, the council’s Conservative leader, conceded the authority had not yet resolved how to handle tourist traffic via the Channel tunnel if disruption were to occur, and added that the UK would be heavily reliant on the response of the French.“The authorities have promised that Calais will run smoothly and we hope it will, but there were long delays last week when there was a go-slow when they protested about a lack of resources to handle Brexit,” Carter said.May herself is expected to support ruling out a no-deal exit on 29 March. Referring to Northern Ireland, she said she was conscious of “the potential damage to the union that leaving without a deal could do when one part of our country is without devolved governance”.Neither Dublin, London nor the EU have published their no-deal plans for Northern Ireland because they have been deemed so sensitive.Any warnings over the prospect of a renewal of violence or civil disobedience will be designed to concentrate the minds of the Democratic Unionist party and the Brexiters who voted against May’s deal.Last month George Hamilton, the head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, warned that border posts and security installations created as a result of a hard Brexit would be seen as “fair game” for attack by dissident republicans.Hamilton also expressed concern that the disappearance of the European arrest warrant would mean fugitives could disappear across the border into the republic of Ireland with impunity.In an interview with the Guardian last month, Hamilton described as “severe” the violent threat from the New IRA and other terrorist groups opposed to the peace settlement. A group calling itself the IRA claimed responsibility for parcel bombs sent to British targets last week.Tariff schedules will have serious implications for businesses and farming in Northern Ireland which operate an all-island supply chain, forcing crippling costs on them.The Home Office said: “The government is making preparations for all eventualities, including a no deal.

3934,"The claims that British trade with the Commonwealth can make up for leaving the EU is “the nuttiest of the many nutty arguments” advanced by Brexit supporters and “utter bollocks”, the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd has said.In a lacerating piece for the Guardian, Rudd dismissed the claims by some Brexit supporters that the UK could strike deals with his country, New Zealand, Canada and India to soften the blow and said the UK risked undermining western values by leaving the EU in a weaker position when it left.“I’m struck, as the British parliament moves towards the endgame on Brexit, with the number of times Australia, Canada, New Zealand and India have been advanced by the Brexiteers in the public debate as magical alternatives to Britain’s current trade and investment relationship with the European Union,” he wrote.“This is the nuttiest of the many nutty arguments that have emerged from the Land of Hope and Glory set now masquerading as the authentic standard-bearers of British patriotism. It’s utter bollocks.”Of the prospect of a free trade deal with Delhi, he writes: “As for India, good luck!”Rudd, a former chair of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, noted that, while Australia, Canada and New Zealand would remain supportive of a post-Brexit UK, their combined population of about 65 million people does not “come within a bull’s roar of Britain’s adjacent market of 450 million Europeans”.And he cast serious doubt on suggestions the UK could quickly come to a free trade agreement (FTA) with India, pointing out that talks he began with the nation on behalf of Australia a decade ago are still going on. “A substantive India-UK FTA is the ultimate mirage constructed by the Brexiteers. It’s as credible as the ad they plastered on the side of that big red bus about the £350m Britain was allegedly paying to Brussels each week. Not.”Rudd was writing as the British prime minister, Theresa May, made a last-ditch dash to Strasbourg in an effort to negotiate a form of Brexit she could get past MPs, who have overwhelmingly rejected her approach in the Commons. The government has indicated that it intends to honour its commitment to hold a meaningful vote on her Brexit deal on Tuesday, with less than three weeks remaining before the nation leaves the EU.Rudd, who was Australian prime minister from 2007 to 2010 and again for a short spell in 2013, urged the UK to “use this critical fortnight to start turning all this around”.He argued that there was a reason to do so “beyond Britain’s own demonstrable economic self-interest”, claiming that a weaker Europe – alongside a more inward-looking US – could only lead to a weakening of the “continuing idea of ‘the west’”.“If the American pillar is looking a little shaky, Europe is looking even shakier. The strength of the political emergence of the far right across Europe’s four largest countries and economies – Germany, France, Italy and Spain – is frightening. The European political centre is being hollowed out,” he wrote.“For Britain’s economic self-interest, as well as the wider political interests of the western community of nations, Britain should remain in the EU.”",Former Australian PM calls Brexit trade plan ‘utter bollocks’,2019-03-11/20:06:48+0000,the claims that british trade with the commonwealth can make up for leaving the eu is the nuttiest of the many nutty arguments advanced by brexit supporters and utter bollocks the former australian prime minister kevin rudd has said in a lacerating piece for the guardian rudd dismissed the claims by some brexit supporters that the uk could strike deals with his country new zealand canada and india to soften the blow and said the uk risked undermining western values by leaving the eu in a weaker position when it left i m struck as the british parliament moves towards the endgame on brexit with the number of times australia canada new zealand and india have been advanced by the brexiteers in the public debate as magical alternatives to britain s current trade and investment relationship with the european union he wrote this is the nuttiest of the many nutty arguments that have emerged from the land of hope and glory set now masquerading as the authentic standard bearers of british patriotism it s utter bollocks of the prospect of a free trade deal with delhi he writes as for india good luck rudd a former chair of the commonwealth ministerial action group noted that while australia canada and new zealand would remain supportive of a post brexit uk their combined population of about  million people does not come within a bull s roar of britain s adjacent market of  million europeans and he cast serious doubt on suggestions the uk could quickly come to a free trade agreement fta with india pointing out that talks he began with the nation on behalf of australia a decade ago are still going on a substantive india uk fta is the ultimate mirage constructed by the brexiteers it s as credible as the ad they plastered on the side of that big red bus about the m britain was allegedly paying to brussels each week not rudd was writing as the british prime minister theresa may made a last ditch dash to strasbourg in an effort to negotiate a form of brexit she could get past mps who have overwhelmingly rejected her approach in the commons the government has indicated that it intends to honour its commitment to hold a meaningful vote on her brexit deal on tuesday with less than three weeks remaining before the nation leaves the eu rudd who was australian prime minister from  to  and again for a short spell in  urged the uk to use this critical fortnight to start turning all this around he argued that there was a reason to do so beyond britain s own demonstrable economic self interest claiming that a weaker europe alongside a more inward looking us could only lead to a weakening of the continuing idea of the west if the american pillar is looking a little shaky europe is looking even shakier the strength of the political emergence of the far right across europe s four largest countries and economies germany france italy and spain is frightening the european political centre is being hollowed out he wrote for britain s economic self interest as well as the wider political interests of the western community of nations britain should remain in the eu ,Brexit,0.19193826615810394
3974,"Theresa May was battling on Sunday night to save her Brexit deal and prolong her premiership, amid signs Eurosceptics could move against her if there is a delay to leaving the EU.The prime minister’s position looked precarious as she was unable to announce any progress in talks with the EU less than 48 hours before her House of Commons vote on the deal.One Downing Street insider said the week ahead looked “choppy” as parliament is likely to vote to extend article 50 and rule out a no-deal Brexit if MPs do not approve May’s withdrawal agreement with the EU.Two former cabinet ministers – Nicky Morgan and Dominic Raab – suggested that her premiership would be in trouble in that scenario, with speculation that Eurosceptics will try to force her out.To avoid that threat, May will need votes in the week ahead from about 100 Tory and Democratic Unionist party Eurosceptics, who want an assurance that the UK will not indefinitely be bound by the Irish backstop and a permanent customs union with the EU.In a last-ditch effort to win over the rebels, ministers were discussing whether the prime minister could even offer to name a departure date if it would help the deal to pass, while Philip Hammond, the chancellor, was preparing to offer billions to “end austerity” in the spring statement.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, also warned Eurosceptics that failing to back May’s deal meant there was “a risk and a possibility that we end up losing Brexit in the next couple of weeks”.But hardline pro-Brexit supporters were holding their nerve and insisting they would still only consider backing a deal if Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has changed his mind about the permanent nature of the backstop.Steve Baker, a leading figure in the European Research Group, said: “I am clear a change of prime minister would not create an escape from the backstop unless the new prime minister were willing and able to breach international law. And that is absolutely not who we are as a fair-dealing UK.”To those warning of a threat to Brexit, he said: “The people who would stop Brexit should know just this: what you do, you’ll have to do in public now. Stopping Brexit will be on you, not Brexiteers. Don’t kid yourselves otherwise.”David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, also said an offer by May to resign “would not be enough” and warned that a delay to leaving the EU could cause a backlash amounting to a “Trump moment” among the public. Many Eurosceptics will oppose a delay not just over fears it could lead to a second referendum but also the likelihood that the EU would increase the UK’s exit bill by billions of pounds. May was also facing difficulty securing enough Labour votes to get the deal through, despite attempting to woo them with a package of guarantees on workers’ rights and cash for towns across the UK.If May fears she is heading for a heavy defeat she may pull the vote on her deal and instead hold an indicative vote to show the EU what parliament would accept before attempting another negotiation, but there is no certainty that Brussels would be open to more talks without a change in direction towards a softer Brexit. In an article for the Guardian, Sam Gyimah, a Conservative who resigned as a minister to back a people’s vote, warned his colleagues across the parties against voting for the deal under government pressure, suggesting bad policy decisions such as the Iraq war were made under similar circumstances.“The framing of the choice is similar to the one MPs were presented with in the run-up to the Iraq war: military action against Saddam Hussein, or the risk of an attack on this country,” he said.“The prime minister’s version is a similarly artificial choice: her deal, or a chaotic and disorderly exit from the EU that we know will have severe consequences for our communities. MPs are effectively being asked to choose between the frying pan and the fire, in the hope they will choose the former and that will somehow be declared as a victory.”The prime minister was poised to fly to Brussels in the early hours of Monday if there were signs of a breakthrough but she was still undecided late on Sunday night about whether to make a last-minute dash. She was also wavering over whether to make a statement on the issue in the Commons on Monday.If May fails to pass her deal, Labour said it was open to working with other parties to secure a better Brexit deal involving a customs union. But the prospect of parliament seizing control of the negotiations has heightened the chance of Tory Eurosceptics attempting to replace May.His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt’s attempts to talk up a backstory as an 'underestimated' entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse.Overall, Hunt’s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the 'Theresa in trousers' nickname among some Tory MPs – one that is more catchy than accurate (since May herself often wears trousers).In the final round of MP voting Hunt edged out Michael Gove, 77 votes to 75.Johnson’s progress to Downing Street appeared unstoppable even before an overwhelming victory in the first round of voting among MPs. Most of his colleagues believe it is now all but inevitable that he will be Britain’s next prime minister.His well-disciplined campaign team will continue with their strategy of subjecting him to minimal media exposure, though once the field is narrowed down to two, the final pair will appear in more than a dozen head-to-head hustings for Tory members. The team’s main aim is simply to keep heads down and avoid Johnson creating headlines for the wrong reasons. It may not have worked. Johnson came first in the final round of MP voting with 160 votes.Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary who is tipped to run for leader and already has a grassroots supporters group called Ready for Raab, told Sky News: “She has said she is going to step down. I would like to see her able to do that in a way of her own choosing. But the government has found itself in a precarious situation and, particularly if the government extends article 50 or tries to reverse the Brexit promises that we have made, I think that situation will get even trickier.”Morgan, the former education secretary, also told the BBC’s The World This Weekend that it would be the “beginning of the end” for May’s policy if the Commons again votes down her deal and then votes against a no-deal Brexit and for an extension of article 50.“I think that her position is going to become slowly less and less tenable as parliament changes the government’s Brexit policy,” she said. “If the votes go this week in a way which means that the prime minister’s policy as she has set out and stuck to rigidly over the course of the last two-and-a-bit years is taken away, dismantled slowly by parliament this week, I think it would be very difficult for the prime minister to stay in office for very much longer.”She suggested the cabinet would have to “take a role in saying potentially to the prime minister, ‘Actually, things have changed significantly. We think you should think about your position, prime minister.’”",Theresa May battles to save Brexit deal amid threats to oust her,2019-03-10/20:26:26+0000,theresa may was battling on sunday night to

3980,"The shadow chancellor has said Labour would back a delay to Brexit to help secure a better withdrawal deal, as the party retreated from supporting a parliamentary vote on a second referendum this week.John McDonnell said it was no longer the right time to vote on a second referendum on Tuesday, because the priority should be defeating May’s Brexit and then trying to help negotiate a better one.He had previously said Labour would either put forward an amendment calling for a second referendum or support a backbench one at the time May put her Brexit deal to a vote on 12 March.His comments will disappoint some in the party who want Labour to have a clear position in favour of a second referendum as the top priority. Senior figures in the People’s Vote campaign, however, believe there is not yet enough support in parliament for a second referendum. Alastair Campbell said this would only happen when “it becomes clear there is not a majority for any specific form of Brexit”.McDonnell suggested Labour would back an extension to article 50 to give time to seek a better deal when that option is put to a vote on Thursday. He said the party could help to secure such agreement involving a customs union within weeks, but that article 50 should be extended as long as was necessary to strike a deal.He said it was still Labour’s policy to support a second referendum, but only if parliament proved unable to agree on a better outcome than May’s withdrawal agreement.He told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: “We’ve got to abide by exactly what we’ve said at Labour party conference, which is we go through the sequence of respecting the referendum, preventing a reckless deal that Theresa May is bringing forward, preventing a no deal, looking to see how we can construct a deal which we think could protect jobs and the economy, and failing that going for a general election or failing that going back to the people.“And this week, we thought this would be the week in which Theresa May brought back for a meaningful vote a different deal, a new deal. It doesn’t look like that. It looks as though she’s bringing back the same deal, so I think it will have the same result and it’ll be thrown out. And then we’ll move into a situation where we, at least we can try and vote down a no deal, and then I think, yes, further negotiations will take place.“My view is everything we do this week has got to prevent a no deal and a bad deal. Other discussions will take place but we’ll always, exactly as our party conference said, we’ll always keep on the agenda if necessary. If parliament can’t agree we’ll have to go back to the people. We’ll be forced to.”His position was echoed by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who suggested Labour wanted a straightforward vote on May’s deal on Tuesday. “I think across parliament now people know the deal is the same. There is a strong sense that it should be an up-down vote on the deal,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.“Now that is not just a Labour position. Back on 15 January, when we first went through this exercise, there were lots of amendments down and, in the end, across the house, everybody pretty well pulled their amendments and said we need to know the size of the defeat, if it is a defeat, and we are back to that moment on Tuesday.“That doesn’t mean that the public vote is gone, it doesn’t mean we won’t come to it … Tuesday is about exposing the weakness of the prime minister and then moving on.”Starmer suggested Labour would prefer to back an amendment by backbench MPs than tabling its own, because such a strategy would be more likely to attract support across parliament. He also said Labour’s default position ought to be supporting remain if there were a public vote.Labour wants to throw its weight behind an amendment by Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, two backbench MPs, which would offer a referendum on any deal achieved by the government versus a remain option.The MPs, however, are now not likely to put that amendment to a vote this week given the scale of defeat that May is likely to face on her deal.Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, accused Labour of pulling its punches. “Labour’s apparent belated support for a people’s vote needs to be put to the test very soon. If not Tuesday, when? And their commitment must go hand in hand with a three-line whip,” he said.Scottish Labour’s conference voted earlier on Sunday to support a second referendum on Brexit, reflecting UK Labour policy to “put forward or support an amendment in favour of a public vote, between the option on the one hand of a credible leave deal and on the other hand remain”.","Brexit: Labour would back delay to seek

4035,"Theresa May has urged parliament to “get it done” and back her Brexit deal, in an impassioned speech that offered no new concessions for wavering MPs before next week’s crucial vote.Speaking at a dockside warehouse in the pro-leave town of Grimsby, May repeatedly declined to accept any personal responsibility for the ongoing uncertainty or give any clues as to what she would do if the vote was lost.The speech prompted a withering response from the CBI, whose deputy head said the prime minister’s message was “not good enough”.Addressing workers from Ørsted, a Danish energy and wind turbine firm, May urged the EU to make new concessions over the Irish backstop – the issue that caused many of her MPs to vote against the deal the first time – before expected last-ditch talks in Brussels this weekend.May accused Jeremy Corbyn of trying to frustrate Brexit, and she implored Labour MPs in leave-voting seats, such as Grimsby’s Melanie Onn who attended the event, to back her deal.She said if her plan was voted down again in the Commons on Tuesday, the result would be more economic uncertainty and delay and the possibility of Brexit being either watered down or even overturned.A vote against the deal would mean “not completing Brexit and getting on with all the other important issues people care about, just yet more months and years arguing”, May said. “If we go down that road we might never leave the EU at all.”She added: “My message to those MPs who agree with me that we should not risk that is simple: the only certain way to avoid it is to back the deal the government has secured with EU on Tuesday. Let’s get it done.”The EU “has to make a choice too”, the prime minister said. “We are both participants in this process. It is in the European interest for the UK to leave with a deal. We are working with them but the decisions that the European Union makes over the next few days will have a big impact on the outcome of the vote.“European leaders tell me they worry that time is running out and that we only have one chance to get it right. My message to them is: now is the moment for us to act.”May again talked up her plans on workers’ rights and the redevelopment of towns such as Grimsby, stressing what she said were the benefits of her deal to the fishing industry. However, there was nothing new in policy terms.Asked three times after the speech if she accepted any personal blame, May refused to engage with the issue or say what might happen if the deal was lost again.Asked if she was to blame at all for the lack of certainty just three weeks before the supposed departure date of 29 March, May said: “You mentioned the next few weeks – I would say now is the moment for us to get this done. Now is the moment for parliament to back the deal and to deliver what people voted for.”Asked what might happen with promised votes on no deal or extending the Brexit deadline if her vote was lost, May said: “My focus is on the debate that will take place on Tuesday and getting that vote through.”Asked whether she owed business an apology rather than an explanation for what could happen after Tuesday, May said it was up to MPs to “vote to end that uncertainty”.Joshua Hardie, the deputy director general of the CBI, tweeted: “Businesses are tired of Groundhog Day. If the government deal falls, MPs must avoid no deal and get behind something else, fast. Meanwhile investment and sales will continue to suffer.”A Labour source said of May’s speech: “Is that it?

4101,"The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has urged hard Brexiters to vote for Theresa May’s withdrawal deal or risk a soft Brexit compromise, even if concessions on the backstop can’t be secured from the EU.Hammond admitted that convincing Brussels to accept legal binding changes to the backstop on the Irish border was proving a “challenge”.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said that even if those assurances could not be secured, he urged the “Brexit wing of the party” to get behind the deal in the crucial meaningful vote next Tuesday or risk uncertainty over Brexit.His warning came after France urged the UK negotiating team, headed by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, to come up with fresh proposals to end the Brexit impasse.Hammond said: “I hope they [Cox and Barclay] will come back with an offer that my colleagues on the Brexit wing of the party will consider very, very carefully in the context of the real situation that we are in, because if the prime minister’s deal does not get approved on Tuesday then it is likely that the House of Commons will vote to extend the article 50 procedure to not leave the EU without a deal, and where we go thereafter is highly uncertain.”He added: “For those people who are passionate about ensuring that we leave the EU on time, it surely must be something that they need to think very carefully about now, because they run the risk of us moving away from their preferred course of action if we don’t get this deal through on Tuesday.”The chancellor said failing to back the deal could involve signing up to a customs union compromise currently being discussed by senior Tory backbenchers and Labour’s leadership.Hammond said: “The Labour party has been talking for a long time about the idea of a customs union grafted onto the PM’s deal. Those of my colleagues who feel very strongly against that proposal need to think very hard about the implications of voting against the prime minister’s deal next Tuesday, because we will then be in unknown territory where a consensus will have to be forged across the House of Commons and that will inevitably mean compromises being made.”He also pointedly refused to say whether he would resign from the government if the prime minister instructed MPs to vote for a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday if her deal was rejected on Tuesday.He said: “I’ve always said that I believe that it would be a very bad outcome for the UK to leave the European Union without a deal, but there isn’t a motion yet … so I can’t say how I will vote on a motion that hasn’t been tabled.”Hammond suggested that the government would not whip MPs to vote for no deal.He said: “I think the government is very clear where the will of parliament is on this. Parliament will vote not to leave the EU without a deal next Wednesday. I have a high degree of confidence about that. But we do need to have a clear confirmation.”Hammond also claimed that more money would be available for public spending if MPs voted for May’s deal.He said: “We have got a spending review coming up this summer that will set budgets for the next three years. We will have more money to spend on public services and, if we get the right Brexit deal done and a smooth exit from the European Union so that we can release the money that we have set aside to deal with the possible disruption of a no-deal exit, then that will give us more money still.“If the money is spent on dealing with the disruption of a no-deal exit it can’t be spent on policing, on social care, on schools, on higher education, on defence and all the other things that people are expecting.”","Back May’s deal or risk soft Brexit, Hammond tells Tories",2019-03-07/10:15:47+0000,the chancellor philip hammond has urged hard brexiters to vote for theresa may s withdrawal deal or risk a soft brexit compromise even if concessions on the backstop can t be secured from the eu hammond admitted that convincing brussels to accept legal binding changes to the backstop on the irish border was proving a challenge speaking to bbc radio  s today programme he said that even if those assurances could not be secured he urged the brexit wing of the party to get behind the deal in the crucial meaningful vote next tuesday or risk uncertainty over brexit his warning came after france urged the uk negotiating team headed by the attorney general geoffrey cox and the brexit secretary stephen barclay to come up with fresh proposals to end the brexit impasse hammond said i hope they cox and barclay will come back with an offer that my colleagues on the brexit wing of the party will consider very very carefully in the context of the real situation that we are in because if the prime minister s deal does not get approved on tuesday then it is likely that the house of commons will vote to extend the article  procedure to not leave the eu without a deal and where we go thereafter is highly uncertain he added for those people who are passionate about ensuring that we leave the eu on time it surely must be something that they need to think very carefully about now because they run the risk of us moving away from their preferred course of action if we don t get this deal through on tuesday the chancellor said failing to back the deal could involve signing up to a customs union compromise currently being discussed by senior tory backbenchers and labour s leadership hammond said the labour party has been talking for a long time about the idea of a customs union grafted onto the pm s deal those of my colleagues who feel very strongly against that proposal need to think very hard about the implications of voting against the prime minister s deal next tuesday because we will then be in unknown territory where a consensus will have to be forged across the house of commons and that will inevitably mean compromises being made he also pointedly refused to say whether he would resign from the government if the prime minister instructed mps to vote for a no deal brexit on wednesday if her deal was rejected on tuesday he said i ve always said that i believe that it would be a very bad outcome for the uk to leave the european union without a deal but there isn t a motion yet so i can t say how i will vote on a motion that hasn t been tabled hammond suggested that the government would not whip mps to vote for no deal he said i think the government is very clear where the will of parliament is on this parliament will vote not to leave the eu without a deal next wednesday i have a high degree of confidence about that but we do need to have a clear confirmation hammond also claimed that more money would be available for public spending if mps voted for may s deal he said we have got a spending review coming up this summer that will set budgets for the next three years we will have more money to spend on public services and if we get the right brexit deal done and a smooth exit from the european union so that we can release the money that we have set aside to deal with the possible disruption of a no deal exit then that will give us more money still if the money is spent on dealing with the disruption of a no deal exit it can t be spent on policing on social care on schools on higher education on defence and all the other things that people are expecting ,Brexit,0.3271356225013733
4119,"Brexit is a “huge help” to Irish republicanism and will fuel violent resistance to British rule in Northern Ireland, a dissident republican leader has claimed.The UK’s departure from the European Union has refocused attention on the border and the “colonialist” partition of Ireland, boosting efforts to politicise a new generation of Irish nationalists, Brian Kenna, chairman of the political party Saoradh, told the Guardian.“Brexit has been a small pilot light in reigniting that side of physical force to British occupation,” he said.Kenna spoke in an interview before three improvised explosive devices were found at separate transport hubs in London on Tuesday. At least two of the packages bore Irish stamps and postmarks.No one has claimed responsibility but, on Wednesday, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, hinted that republican extremists were suspected by expressing “anger and embarrassment” at the “warped thinking” behind the packages.Ireland’s justice minister, Charlie Flanagan, called the parcel-bombing attempt “a sinister act”.An Irish security source said “violent dissident republicans” were the most likely source, pointing to previous letter bomb attacks on targets in Britain and Northern Ireland in 2013 and 2014.Saoradh, which means Liberation in Irish, is a small revolutionary party which rejects the peace process and the Good Friday agreement – and, by extension, Sinn Féin – as tools of partition. The party is believed to share ideology and overlapping membership with the New IRA, a dissident group which claimed responsibility for a car bomb outside a court in Derry in January.Ger Devereux, Saoradh’s general secretary, denied any knowledge of the incendiary packages sent to London, saying the party engaged in legitimate political activism. “Anything that happens outside of that, we have no knowledge of or involvement in,” he said.Speaking on Monday in Dublin, Kenna, 57, the party’s chairman, also distanced Saoradh from the New IRA. But he said a new generation of republicans was committed to using force to achieve a united Ireland.“Every generation going back 800 years, Irish republicans have confronted British occupation. I don’t see any reason why that’s going to stop,” he said.Brexit was giving a boost to resistance, which went through cycles of “highs and lows”, said Kenna.“Brexit is a huge opportunity. It’s not the reason why people would resist British rule but Brexit just gives it focus, gives it a physical picture. It’s a huge help.”Security forces had infiltrated and surveilled republican ranks but resistance would continue and grow, said the chairman. “The republican movement is very adaptable. Necessity is the mother of invention.”The campaign would be smaller than that waged by the Provisional IRA during the Troubles but could still be “impactful” and “very difficult to stop”, he claimed.In the absence of a militarised border or troops on the streets, republican socialist ideology was incentivising recruits, said Kenna. “Young people are now getting involved in an armed campaign without a personal experience of oppression.”The return of customs posts or any border infrastructure would underline the reason for resistance, he said. “That border denies our national sovereignty and partitions our island. Brexit has brought that into focus.”Saoradh, which was formed in 2016, has published a 14-page policy document on Brexit. It considers the UK’s vote to leave the EU a historic opportunity but wants Ireland to also leave, considering the EU a capitalist usurpation of national sovereignty and workers’ rights.Saoradh members appointed Kenna, who has served a prison sentence for IRA membership, at a party conference in the border town of Dundalk last November.Despite the collapse of power-sharing at Stormont in 2017, which has paralysed politics in Northern Ireland, there is little evidence that violent dissidents are filling the vacuum.The New IRA emerged in 2012 via a merger of several groups opposed to the peace process, including the Real IRA. It has been linked with the murder of two prison officers and multiple other attacks.Police chiefs say they are taking the threat seriously but play down dissidents’ capacity for sustained or sophisticated attacks.Marisa McGlinchey, author of the book Unfinished Business, an academic investigation of dissident republicans, said Saoradh reflected the thinking of the New IRA and included prominent former members of the Provisional IRA.“They share an ideology. It’s suspected that there’s an overlap in membership,” she said.Saoradh members had joined other groups in civic campaigns against evictions and water charges but, since the party did not participate in elections, it was difficult to gauge support, said McGlinchey. “They don’t seem realistically to be tapping into wider currents.”Hardline republicans were split between several rival parties, including Republican Sinn Féin, she said. “There seems to be no sign of a cohesive support base. It’s just so divided.”McGlinchey said the incendiary packages sent to London were not necessarily the work of republicans. “If it is, the message is that they’re still here and that they’re still capable of doing it,” she added.","Brexit is a 'huge help' to Irish republicanism, says dissident leader",2019-03-06/19:41:40+0000,brexit is a huge help to irish republicanism and will fuel violent

4246,"Left-behind towns in England are to get a £1.6bn funding boost as part of a package of measures to win support for Theresa May’s Brexit deal among Labour MPs, who said the new cash would not buy their votes.Labour MPs including Lisa Nandy and Gareth Snell who have signalled they might back May’s deal criticised the approach and said the cash would do little to tackle the effects of austerity. The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, denied the money was a Brexit bribe and said it would be enough to have a “transformative” impact on areas that felt left behind.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday, he refused to say how many towns would benefit, but pointed out that the cash would be allocated whatever happens in next week’s meaningful vote on the EU withdrawal bill.“This funding is there regardless of the outcome … there is no conditionality,” he said. “This funding is there to see that towns grow … and we leave no part of our UK left behind.”Brokenshire said the money would be available until 2026, which would equate to as little as £320m per year assuming that the funds take a year to allocate.The prime minister said the Stronger Towns Fund, much of it allocated to the north of England and the Midlands, would go to areas that had not “shared the proceeds of growth”.May, who is also expected to announce post-Brexit guarantees on workers’ and trade union rights in the coming days, said £1bn had been allocated already, of which more than half would go to the north of England, where places such as Wakefield, Doncaster and Wigan voted heavily for Brexit.About £322m will go to towns in the Midlands, where the leave vote in places such as Stoke-on-Trent, Mansfield and Wolverhampton was high. Nandy, the MP for Wigan and a former shadow minister, said towns such as hers had been “shamefully ignored for decades” and the new fund must represent the start of an overhaul in the government’s approach to investment.“If it is a one-off payment designed to help the prime minister ahead of a key Brexit vote, it will fail and confirm to people in our towns that the government is not serious in its commitment to our communities,” she said.Snell, the MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, one of the MPs who has been negotiating with the government about new guarantees for workers, said the money for his region would not even cover the cuts made by his local council.“Regardless of how much money the prime minister promises communities like the West Midlands, I will make up my mind on how I vote based on the terms of the deal,” he said. “There is no price on my vote. The West Midlands is getting £212m, which is a good starting point to address the problems we are facing but in context, that £212m for the whole region is less than the total amount that Stoke city council has had to cut from its budget in the last nine years because of austerity. So it is not a big windfall that will make everything right.”No 10 said communities would be given some say about how to spend the money in their towns via local enterprise partnerships. The remaining £600m will be available through a bidding process to communities in any part of the country, a sweetener to Conservative MPs who had demanded their areas receive equal treatment.Announcing the fund, May linked the new money directly to the leave votes from the towns it would benefit. “Communities across the country voted for Brexit as an expression of their desire to see change. That must be a change for the better, with more opportunity and greater control,” she said. “These towns have a glorious heritage, huge potential and, with the right help, a bright future ahead of them.”Conservative MPs were disconcerted that the pledge had been linked to securing the votes of Labour MPs. Robert Halfon, the MP for Harlow, pushed the prime minister during PMQs last week for reassurance that towns such as his in Essex would be able to make the case for more funding.“I welcome that £600m has been pledged to towns across UK – like Harlow –with significant disadvantage and deprivation,” he said. “It is vital that this fund is not seen as pork-barrel politics, but a way for all poorer communities to benefit post-Brexit.”Brexiter MPs also expressed caution about the cash. Simon Clarke, the Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, who previously voted against May’s deal, said: “What this money won’t do is buy any votes in parliament. I am determined to deliver a proper Brexit, which means fixing the backstop, while all the local Labour MPs are unapologetically in denial about the need to leave the EU at all.”Labour and campaigners for a second referendum dismissed May’s announcement. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the fund “smacks of desperation from a government reduced to bribing MPs to vote for their damaging flagship Brexit legislation”.He said towns were struggling because of “a decade of cuts, including to council funding, and a failure to invest in businesses and our communities”. Labour would establish a network of regional development banks to finance growth in smaller towns, he said. “No Brexit bribery. Stable investment where it’s most needed.”Anna Soubry, part of the breakaway Independent Group, said it was “a desperate measure to buy votes” and compared it with the £1bn the DUP secured for Northern Ireland as part of its confidence and supply agreement.“Now Theresa May is so desperate to get votes for a bad EU withdrawal agreement she is relying on the same old trick,” Soubry said. “Voters will not be fooled, especially those in areas which voted leave and are now demanding a people’s vote because they know whichever way you do it, Brexit will harm their futures.”• This article

4442,"Stars of the hit television show Derry Girls have joined a group of female MPs in a march on Westminster calling for the extension of abortion rights to Northern Ireland.The women, including the actors Siobhan McSweeney and Nicola Coughlan, formed part of a group of 28 to symbolise the number of people who leave Northern Ireland for England and Wales each week to have an abortion.The women carried suitcases containing sheets of paper with the names of 62,000 people who have called for the decriminalisation of abortion in Northern Ireland.28 women are walking over Westminster bridge in solidarity with the 28 women who every week have to fly from NI to rest of the UK for abortions. V moving. #NowForNI pic.twitter.com/UijsgEqtM1Coughlan, who plays Clare Devlin and is from Cork, said: “Women are being treated like criminals in their own country. I’ve had friends who have had to make this journey, it feels very personal as well.”Westminster has a duty of care to reform the legislation prohibiting abortion in Northern Ireland, said McSweeney, who plays Sister Michael in the comedy. “It’s a sorry state of affairs when somebody from the telly has to tell [politicians] how to do their job. They have been neglecting their duty.”Karin Smyth, the shadow Northern Ireland minister, was also among the protesters. “In England, women have had this right for 50 years, and somehow we think it’s acceptable that women don’t have the same human rights as us,” she said. “That’s unacceptable. Women are being squeezed between this argument about devolution and human rights.”The SNP MP for Livingston, Hannah Bardell, called Northern Ireland’s abortion rights “a stain on the UK’s democracy”.

If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And catch our monthly Brexit Means … podcast here.Producing the Guardian’s independent, in-depth journalism takes time and money. We do it because we believe our perspective matters, and it may be yours too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please support us. Thank you.On and on and on it goes. Sparking a fierce backlash, Theresa May delayed MPs’ next “meaningful” vote on her Brexit deal until 12 March – barely a fortnight before Britain is due to leave the EU (a feat she described as “still within our grasp”).The prime minister also insisted Brexit “must not, will not be blocked”, and dismissed pressure on her to step down after senior government figures told the Guardian she should go once the first phase of Brexit is delivered or face a no-confidence vote in parliament.Faced with yet more can-kicking, an increasingly exasperated EU27 – determined to avoid the uncertainty of repeated three-month extension requests – let it be known it might just prefer delaying Brexit until 2021 while the UK sorts itself out.With the EU unwilling to make the kind of “legally binding changes” to the Irish backstop that Britain wants, the chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, said there was now a high chance of an “accidental” no-deal Brexit.But as the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, seeks to translate the bloc’s earlier assurances over the temporary nature of the backstop into a legal protocol acceptable to hardline Brexiters, Donald Tusk, the EU council president, said the EU would favour an article 50 extension as a “rational solution” if the deal is not ratified soon.May continues to insist she does not want an extension. But up to 25 members of her government, including four cabinet ministers – David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Mundell – are ready to vote for a Brexit delay, while dozens of moderate Conservative MPs are also prepared to vote against the government to avoid no deal.Labour, meanwhile, has finally come off the fence, saying it will back a second vote if parliament rejects a plan it will table this week for a permanent and comprehensive customs union and close alignment with the single market. Jeremy Corbyn said the party would also back the Cooper-Letwin amendment (see below) to avert no deal.With eight Labour MPs having now left the opposition party to form the Independent Group, May was further weakened by the decision of three moderate Conservatives to join them over her Brexit policy. The move by Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen underlines how the PM has now exhausted many of her MPs’ patience.On the good news front, analysts predicted that UK food imports from the EU would face a £9bn tariff bill under a no-deal Brexit, with retailers warning of tariffs of up to 40% being imposed on key foodstuffs if the UK crashes out without an agreement.The final Brexit countdown is now under way. Crucial to it is an amendment due to be tabled this week by the former Labour and Conservative ministers Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin. This would instruct May to seek an extension of article 50 if she does not have a deal ratified by 13 March.If the Cooper-Letwin amendment passes and Cox succeeds in coming up with some form of codicil making the non-permanent nature of the backstop solid enough to satisfy the Brexiters, the amended deal – with the alternative being a very long article 50 extension – could conceivably win Commons approval on 13 March.May would then, inevitably, have to ask for a brief extension, maybe two months, to get the withdrawal agreement bill – the full Brexit legislation – through parliament. The EU27 could sign off on the deal at their summit on 21/22 March. And Brexit might then (after a lot of ifs and buts) happen at the beginning of the summer.A lot, though, could still go wrong for May, including mass resignations from the government by members determined to ensure a no-deal Brexit is averted by voting for Cooper-Letwin. And MPs could also, of course, vote for that promised Labour amendment calling for a second referendum.

Why would the British left so blithely enable a Tory project that seeks to cripple it all over again? As Brexit fails to get through parliament, Corbyn should stop pushing for a compromise deal. Instead, Labour should get behind a second referendum. Leave voters would not punish Labour at the next election anywhere near as badly as its remain base: just 36% of Labour leave voters rank Brexit in the top three topics they care about; for Labour remainers, that shoots up to 60%.In the Observer, Will Hutton says Honda’s decision to close its Swindon plant signals the end of a profitable industrial relationship decades in the making:A new Japanese consensus has formed.

4589,"Ireland will no longer recognise the UK driving licences of people living in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The Road Safety Authority of Ireland, a state agency, said this week a mutual recognition agreement would end and that holders of British licences would need to swap them for Irish licences before the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March.“In the event of a no-deal Brexit the driving licence of a UK licence holder living here in Ireland will not be recognised and the driver will not be able to continue to drive here in Ireland on that licence,” the National Driver Licence Service, which issues permits, said in a statement.“The advice to such drivers is that they should exchange their UK driving licence for an Irish driving licence before the 29 March 2019. Under current arrangements a UK licence holder resident here in Ireland has an entitlement to make such an exchange.”Under current rules a UK licence holder can swap a licence and preserve the different categories and permissions conferred by their existing permit. It takes about 17 days to process an application. There is a €55 (£48) fee.Under the Brexit deal that Westminster rejected last month, Ireland and other EU countries would continue to recognise UK licences during a transition period.Last month Irish motorists learned that to drive in Northern Ireland and Britain after a no-deal Brexit they will need “green cards” to prove they are insured.The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland has reportedly sent up to 400,000 green cards to insurance companies. Under current rules the EU’s motor insurance directive allows free movement around the bloc without need for such documentation.The Irish government stepped up no-deal preparations on Friday by publishing a Brexit omnibus bill incorporating 16 pieces of legislation designed to help protect Ireland from the shock of the UK crashing out of the EU.Simon Coveney, the deputy prime minister, said he hoped the legislation would prove “redundant” and never have to be used. “Simply put, as a result of a lot of hard work, my only desire is to see this legislation sit on the shelf.”",UK driving licences will not be valid in Ireland under no-deal Brexit,2019-02-22/13:26:04+0000,ireland will no longer recognise the uk driving licences of people living in ireland in the event of a no deal brexit the road safety authority of ireland a state agency said this week a mutual recognition agreement would end and that holders of british licences would need to swap them for irish licences before the uk is due to leave the eu on  march in the event of a no deal brexit the driving licence of a uk licence holder living here in ireland will not be recognised and the driver will not be able to continue to drive here in ireland on that licence the national driver licence service which issues permits said in a statement the advice to such drivers is that they should exchange their uk driving licence for an irish driving licence before the  march  under current arrangements a uk licence holder resident here in ireland has an entitlement to make such an exchange under current rules a uk licence holder can swap a licence and preserve the different categories and permissions conferred by their existing permit it takes about  days to process an application there is a   fee under the brexit deal that westminster rejected last month ireland and other eu countries would continue to recognise uk licences during a transition period last month irish motorists learned that to drive in northern ireland and britain after a no deal brexit they will need green cards to prove they are insured the motor insurance bureau of ireland has reportedly sent up to   green cards to insurance companies under current rules the eu s motor insurance directive allows free movement around the bloc without need for such documentation the irish government stepped up no deal preparations on friday by publishing a brexit omnibus bill incorporating  pieces of legislation designed to help protect ireland from the shock of the uk crashing out of the eu simon coveney the deputy prime minister said he hoped the legislation would prove redundant and never have to be used simply put as a result of a lot of hard work my only desire is to see this legislation sit on the shelf ,Brexit,0.2843433916568756
4606,"Ireland is accelerating preparations for a no-deal Brexit amid growing alarm that parts of the Irish economy could face severe disruption and even collapse – and that the UK hopes to leverage that prospect to wring concessions from the European Union.Leo Varadkar’s government is due on Friday to publish a mammoth omnibus bill incorporating 16 pieces of legislation to try to shelter Ireland from the doomsday scenario of the UK crashing out of the EU.The parliamentary marathon in Dublin will begin amid increasingly fraught warnings of a hammer blow to agriculture, food processing, transport and other industries.Simon Coveney, the deputy prime minister, told the Dáil on Thursday that the European commission would bail out Ireland’s beef industry in the event of a trade war with Britain. Brussels recognised the sector’s “vulnerability” and would “support and protect” it, he said.Coveney spoke in the wake of reports that Britain envisaged World Trade Organization (WTO) tariffs plus a system of “tariff rate quotas” for some food imports, which would favour big producers such as Brazil at Ireland’s expense.“This would be nothing short of a catastrophe for our beef industry and would have a devastating effect on farmers the length and breadth of this country,” said Lisa Chambers, Brexit spokeswoman for the main opposition party, Fianna Fáil.More than half of Ireland’s annual beef exports are sold in the UK. The Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) estimates WTO tariffs in a no-deal Brexit would cost Ireland’s beef farmers €800m (£695m) per year. A system favouring cheaper imports from Brazil could wipe out Irish beef exports to the UK altogether.“The beef industry is in the front line,” said an IFA spokesman. “If there is a crash-out there has to be comprehensive package of market supports and direct aid to cover the losses.”The food major Kerry Group disclosed this week that it was stockpiling raw materials, while British and Irish retail organisations issued a joint warning about tariffs of 40% on food driving up prices for consumers.Some suspect the UK government is intentionally raising the stakes for Ireland in hope that Dublin will soften its insistence on the Irish backstop and let the EU agree a compromise Brexit deal that Theresa May can bring to Westminster.“The British plan ... echoes tactics used against the government of Éamon de Valera during the Anglo-Irish trade war of the 1930s,” the Irish Independent reported.EU officials also believe that Downing Street is trying to pressure Dublin – with little success. Brussels has been working on a package of temporary support to help ease the short-term impact of a no-deal Brexit, including aid for affected businesses.The IFA spokesperson endorsed that view. “We are very clear that the backstop is not for moving. The idea of the backstop is to maintain the trading relationship that already exists with the EU. As far as we’re concerned we are being supported [in Europe] and will continue to be supported.”But privately EU officials still believe it would be “complete chaos” for the first few days and weeks. Irish businesses are bracing for that.“Call it significant apprehension,” said Paddy Malone, treasurer of Dundalk’s chamber of commerce. “Freight companies are pulling their hair out. If there was certainty we could plan. But they don’t even know what to apply for in terms of state aid because they don’t know what type of aid they may need.”Even so, business owners did not want the backstop diluted to try to avert no deal, said Malone. “The feeling is that it would only postpone the issue, better to face it now.”Andrew Gilmore, deputy director of research at the Dublin-based Institute of International and European Affairs, doubted any British squeeze would succeed. “It’s impossible to imagine a scenario where that kind of pressure will bear results ... especially at this late stage. I don’t see the EU backtracking on its solidarity.”A no-deal Brexit would hurt – for instance, wreaking “catastrophic disruption” on mushroom growers – but Ireland had spent two years preparing for the worst, said Gilmore. “And there is a still strong hope that common sense will prevail.”Conor O’Toole of the Economic and Social Research Institute thinktank said Ireland’s high growth rate would cushion a no-deal Brexit but that high debt levels left the economy vulnerable. Businesses that survived the short-term shock would then face a longer-term challenge, he said. “How do they diversify away from this huge reliance on the UK?”",Ireland steps up effort to shelter economy from no-deal Brexit,2019-02-22/05:00:15+0000,ireland is accelerating preparations for a no deal brexit amid growing alarm that parts of the irish economy could face severe disruption and even collapse and that the uk hopes to leverage that prospect to wring concessions from the european union leo varadkar s government is due on friday to publish a mammoth omnibus bill incorporating  pieces of legislation to try to shelter ireland from the doomsday scenario of the uk crashing out of the eu the parliamentary marathon in dublin will begin amid increasingly fraught warnings of a hammer blow to agriculture food processing transport and other industries simon coveney the deputy prime minister told the dáil on thursday that the european commission would bail out ireland s beef industry in the event of a trade war with britain brussels recognised the sector s vulnerability and would support and protect it he said coveney spoke in the wake of reports that britain envisaged world trade organization wto tariffs plus a system of tariff rate quotas for some food imports which would favour big producers such as brazil at ireland s expense this would be nothing short of a catastrophe for our beef industry and would have a devastating effect on farmers the length and breadth of this country said lisa chambers brexit spokeswoman for the main opposition party fianna fáil more than half of ireland s annual beef exports are sold in the uk the irish farmers association ifa estimates wto tariffs in a no deal brexit would cost ireland s beef farmers m m per year a system favouring cheaper imports from brazil could wipe out irish beef exports to the uk altogether the beef industry is in the front line said an ifa spokesman if there is a crash out there has to be comprehensive package of market supports and direct aid to cover the losses the food major kerry group disclosed this week that it was stockpiling raw materials while british and irish retail organisations issued a joint warning about tariffs of  on food driving up prices for consumers some suspect the uk government is intentionally raising the stakes for ireland in hope that dublin will soften its insistence on the irish backstop and let the eu agree a compromise brexit deal that theresa may can bring to westminster the british plan echoes tactics used against the government of éamon de valera during the anglo irish trade war of the s the irish independent reported eu officials also believe that downing street is trying to pressure dublin with little success brussels has been working on a package of temporary support to help ease the short term impact of a no deal brexit including aid for affected businesses the ifa spokesperson endorsed that view we are very clear that the backstop is not for moving the idea of the backstop is to maintain the trading relationship that already exists with the eu as far as we re concerned we are being supported in europe and will continue to be supported but privately eu officials still believe it would be complete chaos for the first few days and weeks irish businesses are bracing for that call it significant apprehension said paddy malone treasurer of dundalk s chamber of commerce freight companies are pulling their hair out if there was certainty we could plan but they don t even know what to apply for in terms of state aid because they don t know what type of aid they may need even so business owners did not want the backstop diluted to try to avert no deal said malone the feeling is that it would only postpone the issue better to face it now andrew gilmore deputy director of research at the dublin based institute of international and european affairs doubted any british squeeze would succeed it s impossible to imagine a scenario where that kind of pressure will bear results especially at this late stage i don t see the eu backtracking on its solidarity a no deal brexit would hurt for instance wreaking catastrophic disruption on mushroom growers but ireland had spent two years preparing for the worst said gilmore and there is a still strong hope that common sense will prevail conor o toole of the economic and social research institute thinktank said ireland s high growth rate would cushion a no deal brexit but that high debt levels left the economy vulnerable businesses that survived the short term shock would then face a longer term challenge he said how do they diversify away from this huge reliance on the uk ,Brexit,0.23817025125026703
4743,"The British aerospace sector is bracing for a no-deal Brexit, which it estimates could mean billions of pounds in extra costs.The impact on some goods could equate to 38% of their sale value, according to one no-deal Brexit scenario modelled by ADS, a lobby group for the aerospace and defence sectors.The group estimates that new customs checks alone will cost an extra £1.5bn per year. While tariffs are less of an issue for the sector, as most finished aerospace parts are not caught by the levies, import VAT and tariffs on generic parts and raw materials could still add significant costs.That scenario also includes customs checks taking only 70 seconds per vehicle, which the Department for Transport estimates could cause six-day delays at the border.“When you’re selling an aircraft you can’t have any parts missing,” the chief economist at ADS, Jeegar Kakkad, said. “One part stops the whole process.”The output of British aerospace manufacturers fell for the first time in four years in 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics, with concerns around global growth as well as Brexit clouding the outlook.Airbus, one of the UK’s largest aerospace employers at its wing factory and design centre, has warned that a no-deal Brexit could cost it €1bn (£875m) per week, while indicating that it could leave the UK altogether in the event of a disorderly departure. Kakkad added that smaller suppliers are likely to be more vulnerable to problems with cashflow.The aerospace and defence sectors together employed more than 260,000 people in Britain in 2017, according to ADS figures but future expansion by non-British companies could be threatened if new frictions are introduced in the trade between the UK and the EU.Kakkad said: “The issue isn’t about what we have now; it’s if we look halfway through the next decade when decisions are being made on the next set of wings; the next supply chain.”",What are Brexit contingency plans for aerospace and defence?,2019-02-18/14:00:11+0000,the british aerospace sector is bracing for a no deal brexit which it estimates could mean billions of pounds in extra costs the impact on some goods could equate to  of their sale value according to one no deal brexit scenario modelled by ads a lobby group for the aerospace and defence sectors the group estimates that new customs checks alone will cost an extra  bn per year while tariffs are less of an issue for the sector as most finished aerospace parts are not caught by the levies import vat and tariffs on generic parts and raw materials could still add significant costs that scenario also includes customs checks taking only  seconds per vehicle which the department for transport estimates could cause six day delays at the border when you re selling an aircraft you can t have any parts missing the chief economist at ads jeegar kakkad said one part stops the whole process the output of british aerospace manufacturers fell for the first time in four years in  according to the office for national statistics with concerns around global growth as well as brexit clouding the outlook airbus one of the uk s largest aerospace employers at its wing factory and design centre has warned that a no deal brexit could cost it bn m per week while indicating that it could leave the uk altogether in the event of a disorderly departure kakkad added that smaller suppliers are likely to be more vulnerable to problems with cashflow the aerospace and defence sectors together employed more than   people in britain in  according to ads figures but future expansion by non british companies could be threatened if new frictions are introduced in the trade between the uk and the eu kakkad said the issue isn t about what we have now it s if we look halfway through the next decade when decisions are being made on the next set of wings the next supply chain ,Brexit,0.2023136019706726
4913,"Britain is a “waning country” and too small to stand alone on the world stage, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, has claimed in a withering assessment of the UK’s exit from the EU.Rutte, who has emerged as a key player in the talks over the past two years, also warned in an interview that the UK looked to be sliding off the “precipice” towards a “devastating” no-deal Brexit.“Who will be left weakened by Brexit is the United Kingdom,” he said. “It is already weakening, it is a waning country compared to two or three years ago. It is going to become an economy of middling size in the Atlantic Ocean. It is neither the US nor the EU. It is too small to appear on the world stage on its own.”Rutte, who also claimed the Dutch would replace the UK in the bloc as the pre-eminent voice for free trade, has been regularly consulted by Theresa May on progress in the Brexit negotiations.The Netherlands is one of the EU member states that will be most affected by the barriers to trade that will emerge after the UK leaves the bloc, although it has been the beneficiary of some relocations by big businesses.Figures released last week by the Dutch investment agency revealed 42 companies had relocated to the Netherlands in 2018, citing Brexit as a reason, resulting in the movement of 1,923 jobs.Asked whether a Brexit deal was likely, Rutte said in an interview with European media outlets, including the Spanish newspaper El País: “My impression is that the ball is heading towards the precipice and everyone screams to stop, but nobody does anything to stop it, at least, from the British side.”He said of the Irish backstop, which has proven to be the most contentious of issues, that Brussels had no intention of trying to use it to trap Britain in a customs union with the EU.The backstop, under which Northern Ireland would stay in the single market and the whole of the UK would share a customs territory, is to come into force should a future trade deal or alternative arrangement be unable to guarantee the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland.Rutte said: “Some British parliamentarians say that we want to trap them in a permanent limbo. But it is not true. The EU is interested in moving to the next phase as soon as possible and starting a new relationship with the United Kingdom.“But given May’s efforts to renegotiate the Irish safeguard, I do not know how this will end and if we can avoid a hard Brexit.

4982,"Jarosław Granat has worked for Future Processing since it was a scrappy startup run from the first floor of its founder’s house in the southern Polish city of Gliwice. Now the software development company has more than 900 employees based in a gleaming office complex and serves dozens of blue-chip clients around the world.More than half of the company’s clients are in the UK, and Granat fears that two decades of hard work building up the business could now be put at risk by the looming threat of a no-deal Brexit.“We don’t know how Brexit will look and it could be chaos,” he said. “Very few people, including us, believe that no-deal will happen. But maybe we’re just wishing it won’t.”The company, which started life when its CEO, Jarosław Czaja, was a computer science student at Gliwice’s Silesian University of Technology, now has annual revenue of nearly PLN100m (£20m). The overwhelming majority of employees are still based in Gliwice but many travel regularly to Britain.Just as for many British businesses, the most crippling aspect of the ongoing Brexit negotiations for the companies in central and eastern Europe with major links to Britain is the complete lack of any certainty. Many had assumed that a no-deal Brexit was an impossibility, but with two months to go their faith that a workable deal will be agreed on by all sides and passed through parliament is beginning to be tested.For Future Processing, there are three main concerns about a hard Brexit. First, the likelihood that the pound will plummet, creating currency risk. Second, that transport connections between Poland and the UK will be disrupted, making it harder for the Polish company’s representatives to visit British clients. Finally, that the UK breaking away from EU law will create legal uncertainty and potential additional costs as the Polish and British systems diverge.“We understand that people in the UK and politicians might not have considered the implications a few years ago, but the consequences could be drastic,” said Granat.While making preparations is tricky when nobody knows what kind of Brexit to expect, Future Processing has already made attempts to diversify its client base and thus reduce exposure to the British market. It has also introduced flexibility in contracts to protect against currency fluctuations.A no-deal Brexit is likely to have an economic impact in the broader region well beyond the companies that are inextricably tied to Britain. Vladimir Vano, a Bratislava-based analyst and member of the British Chamber of Commerce in Slovakia, estimated that a hard Brexit would lead to a 1% lower GDP for both Slovakia and the Czech Republic, due to trade disruption and increased bureaucracy, with further indirect impact likely as well.“We are on different edges of the EU geographically, but Britain has gone from zero to be the in the top five or six trade partners for Slovakia and the Czech Republic,” he said.The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development estimates that the direct and indirect effects of a no-deal Brexit could lead the broader region to have a 4-5% smaller GDP by 2021 than it would have done otherwise. The automotive industry could be particularly affected by disruption to supply chains, mainly in Slovakia and Hungary.The uncertainty has already led to a slowdown in some sectors. “In the last three months I’ve seen a delay in contracts coming in from Britain, and I fear I’ll have fewer orders from the UK in the near future,” said Genoveva Hristova, managing director of Bulgaria’s Ligna Group, which makes furniture for luxury hotel chains.Britain is in the group’s top three markets, but she said the company’s contractors were already looking to shift business from Britain to central Europe or Germany to avoid potential Brexit hurdles. Her biggest worry about a no-deal Brexit is the potential customs hurdles.As well as exporters, the tourism sector across the region could also be hit by a potential fall in the pound or a Brexit-related economic slowdown.Boris Šuljić runs the boutique Hotel Boškinac and its associated restaurant and winery on the rugged Croatian island of Pag, which has become a popular destination for British foodies and partygoers in recent years.“British guests love it here, for the clean sea, the food and the crazy parties,” he said. “But we are aware that many of them will cut ‘luxury’ expenses and wait for the epilogue of the Brexit process. Tourism will feel the eventual drop in sterling, and the weakening of consumption power from the British market.”Šuljić, like everyone, was uncertain exactly how Brexit might affect his business, and said he hoped that a “compromise” would be achieved to avoid the problems a no-deal Brexit would entail.For most businesses in the region with exposure to the British market, there remains a hope that the worst will not happen, but as each week goes by, the worry increases. Granat admitted to a frustration with British politicians’ failure to agree on a deal and the hopeless Westminster infighting.“It seems like this is a political discussion where everyone needs to think of the overall picture, and the need to find a compromise, rather than pursuing personal goals. We’re keeping our fingers crossed for a postponement, or a second referendum.”4-5% Estimated impact on GDP across the region from a no-deal Brexit.£2.2m Value of Czech car exports to UK.170,000 Jobs

We do it because we believe our perspective matters, and it may be yours too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please support us. Thank you.Jeremy Corbyn wrote to Theresa May offering to throw Labour’s support behind her Brexit deal if she made five binding commitments, including joining a customs union but the prime minister wrote back to say no thanks.Westminster watchers said May’s letter was aimed not just at Corbyn and his MPs, aiming to publicly expose how little space there really is between Labour’s Brexit tests and her negotiated deal but also at the rebels in May’s own party.With the two leaders at least talking cordially to each other, however, it does feel like the prospect of some long-overdue Brexit rapprochement may not not be entirely fanciful – which is more can be said of May’s relationship with the EU.The European council president, Donald Tusk’s remark that there should be a “special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit without a plan drew a predictable response, although at least May left Brussels with a promise of further talks from Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, however, repeated that there was no question of Brussels giving in to Downing Street’s demands on the backstop: “Something has to give” in the UK’s position, he said. “We’re waiting for clarity and movement.”Inevitably, with no new suggestions from London on ways to resolve the Irish backstop problem (here’s the definitive read on that), a crunch vote in which MPs could force Theresa May’s hand could be delayed to the end of the month or later.The prime minister also returned from a brief trip to Northern Ireland no closer to any backstop progress, as the head of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, said the UK was “in the emergency zone of Brexit now” and continued confusion would not just affect jobs and investment but harm the UK as a long-term business destination.Meanwhile, the government has started recruiting civilians for an emergency command-and-control centre tasked with making sure sure Britain runs smoothly after a no-deal Brexit. The Bank of England warned the economy was on course for its weakest year since the global financial crisis.May will make a Commons statement on Tuesday - at which she is expected to ask MPs for another fortnight’s grace - before parliament debates another amendable motion on Thursday. There will be no “meaningful vote” on a revised deal this week (just “as soon as possible”); that is unlikely to be before the end of February, if not even later.If no finalised deal can be put to the Commons by 27 February, MPs would, however, get another amendable motion to consider allowing them to block a no-deal departure or make other interventions.All this cuts deep into the remaining time, piling pressure on the British parliament to then accept what emerges – or face a no-deal scenario. In Brussels, EU officials are considering offering May a detailed plan of what a potential technological solution to the Irish border might look like, which could be included in the legally non-binding political declaration on the future trade deal.Officials believe it is increasingly likely that any renegotiated deal will only be finally put to the Commons at the end of March – necessitating an extension of the article 50 negotiating period to get legislation through parliament.The German finance commissioner, Günther Hermann Oettinger, has suggested the chance of a no-deal Brexit is as high as 60%.Businesses swamped by Brexit urge Gove to delay all other plans.Manufacturing slump puts UK economy into reverse as Brexit looms.No-deal Brexit would make Britain less safe, says police chief.Brexit “can enhance UK’s lethality”, says defence secretary.Cabinet backs Chris Grayling after ferry fiasco, says minister.Tory donors could stop giving after no-deal Brexit.Netherlands talking to 250 firms about leaving UK.‘Buy your wine now’: the Bordeaux vineyards bottling before Brexit.Brexit as disruptive as disease outbreak, says farmers’ leader.End uncertainty over no-deal Brexit, says ex-civil service chief.Shanker Singham owns a firm giving advice on EU exit.Countdown to Brexit: the key dates as UK’s EU exit approaches.Keir Starmer battles to keep Labour support for people’s vote alive.No-deal Brexit: UK exporters risk being locked out of world’s harbours.No-deal Brexit could revive mobile roaming fees, minister confirms.Brexit could be good for UK environment, says top government adviser.Not opposing Brexit could lose Labour 45 seats, says leaked report.No quick fix for citizen rights under no-deal Brexit, says EU official.Business secretary suggests ministers could quit over no-deal Brexit.In the Observer, Nick Cohen says that in the United Kingdom of Absurdistan, a hidden government is preparing for Brexit by keeping us in the dark:As the Institute for Government, MPs and MEPs warn, the real scandal has nothing to do with the fantasy remain bias of the civil service and all to do with secrecy. Businesses don’t know what to expect from government and what they need to do. Neither does the supposedly sovereign people in whose name Brexit is being delivered. Whatever Brexit is, they will be left in ignorance until it is too late to do anything about it.And in the Guardian, Martin Kettle argues that Tusk’s “special place in hell” comment didn’t go nearly far enough in his criticism of clueless Brexiters:Donald Tusk should be criticised not for his malice, but his moderation. He triggered a tsunami of confected outrage from leavers today when he observed, with some justice, that there should be a special place in hell for those who promoted Brexit without a plan.

5218,"Theresa May has failed to rally Northern Ireland support behind her quest for a Brexit deal, as nationalist and unionist parties further entrenched their positions for and against the backstop as she ended a two-day visit to Belfast.The Democratic Unionist party (DUP) insisted on Wednesday that the prime minister should replace the backstop a day after May appeared to soften the government’s stance on the insurance provision to protect against a hard border.Westminster had voted to leave the European Union with “alternative arrangements” for the Irish border, Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, said after meeting May at Stormont.“It is welcome that the prime inister is travelling to Brussels to seek changes but she must stand strong and by the commitments she made to the House of Commons. That is her mandate and that is what I expect. The backstop would undermine the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom ... it is the main problem.”The DUP’s stance will limit the prime minister’s room for manoeuvre when she visits Brussels on Thursday to seek a revised Brexit deal with the EU.May arrived in Belfast on Tuesday saying she sought a deal that would command “broad support” in Northern Ireland.She received a respectful, wary response from business leaders but the party’s five main parties appeared more polarised after meeting her at Stormont. It is the site of the region’s power-sharing assembly, which has been mothballed for two years in a dispute between Sinn Féin and the DUP.The Ulster Unionist party (UUP) urged the prime minister to introduce direct rule government for Northern Ireland if no Brexit deal can be agreed – anathema to republicans.Sinn Féin, which supports the backstop, issued a harsh rebuff to May, saying she lacked credibility and was hostage to the DUP support at Westminster. It called for a referendum on Irish unity.“We are now 51 days from the Brexit deadline and the British prime minister has come here empty handed with the same old rhetoric with no plan, no credibility and frankly no honour,” said Sinn Féin’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald.“We have told her that the British strategy of running down the clock and playing a game of chicken with Ireland and Irish interests is profoundly unacceptable and wrong. We have told her that the days of Britain dictating to Ireland or Irish people, that those days are over and will not return.”McDonald endorsed a statement from Donald Tusk, the European council president, that a “special place in hell” awaited irresponsible Brexiters.Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman in Westminster, called Tusk a “devilish trident-wielding Euro maniac” who disrespected those who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.The mood at Stormont was further soured by the appearance of graffiti saying “IRA here to stay” in five-foot letters across historic walls in Derry, the scene of a New IRA car bomb last month.May is scheduled to visit Dublin on Friday for what are likely to be tense talks with the Irish governmentSpeaking from Brussels the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said the Irish government had secured land at Dublin and Rosslare ports for checks as it ramped up preparations for the UK potentially crashing out without a deal on 29 March.A joint statement from Varadkar and Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, threw cold water on suggestions from some Brexiters that London and Dublin could tweak the backstop.“The backstop is not a bilateral issue, but a European one. Ireland’s border is also the border of the European Union and its market is part of the single market. We will stay united on this matter.”",Brexit: May departs Northern Ireland no closer to backstop deal,2019-02-06/17:47:26+0000,theresa may has failed to rally northern ireland support behind her quest for a brexit deal as nationalist and unionist parties further entrenched their positions for and against the backstop as she ended a two day visit to belfast the democratic unionist party dup insisted on wednesday that the prime minister should replace the backstop a day after may appeared to soften the government s stance on the insurance provision to protect against a hard border westminster had voted to leave the european union with alternative arrangements for the irish border arlene foster the dup leader said after meeting may at stormont it is welcome that the prime inister is travelling to brussels to seek changes but she must stand strong and by the commitments she made to the house of commons that is her mandate and that is what i expect the backstop would undermine the economic and constitutional integrity of the united kingdom it is the main problem the dup s stance will limit the prime minister s room for manoeuvre when she visits brussels on thursday to seek a revised brexit deal with the eu may arrived in belfast on tuesday saying she sought a deal that would command broad support in northern ireland she received a respectful wary response from business leaders but the party s five main parties appeared more polarised after meeting her at stormont it is the site of the region s power sharing assembly which has been mothballed for two years in a dispute between sinn féin and the dup the ulster unionist party uup urged the prime minister to introduce direct rule government for northern ireland if no brexit deal can be agreed anathema to republicans sinn féin which supports the backstop issued a harsh rebuff to may saying she lacked credibility and was hostage to the dup support at westminster it called for a referendum on irish unity we are now  days from the brexit deadline and the british prime minister has come here empty handed with the same old rhetoric with no plan no credibility and frankly no honour said sinn féin s leader mary lou mcdonald we have told her that the british strategy of running down the clock and playing a game of chicken with ireland and irish interests is profoundly unacceptable and wrong we have told her that the days of britain dictating to ireland or irish people that those days are over and will not return mcdonald endorsed a statement from donald tusk the european council president that a special place in hell awaited irresponsible brexiters sammy wilson the dup s brexit spokesman in westminster called tusk a devilish trident wielding euro maniac who disrespected those who voted to leave the eu in the  referendum the mood at stormont was further soured by the appearance of graffiti saying ira here to stay in five foot letters across historic walls in derry the scene of a new ira car bomb last month may is scheduled to visit dublin on friday for what are likely to be tense talks with the irish governmentspeaking from brussels the taoiseach leo varadkar said the irish government had secured land at dublin and rosslare ports for checks as it ramped up preparations for the uk potentially crashing out without a deal on  march a joint statement from varadkar and jean claude juncker the european commission president threw cold water on suggestions from some brexiters that london and dublin could tweak the backstop the backstop is not a bilateral issue but a european one ireland s border is also the border of the european union and its market is part of the single market we will stay united on this matter ,Brexit,0.3040943145751953
5262,"Brexit is about drawing lines on maps and hearts. In that respect it is at odds with the 1998 Good Friday agreement which sought to erase them. Key to ending the Troubles was the removal of the hard border between the north and south of Ireland. Theresa May’s problem is that she has committed to leaving the European Union while respecting the peace deal that depended on both London and Dublin being part of it. The agreement made less salient the questions of identity: under its provisions people in Northern Ireland could be, uncontroversially, citizens of Britain or Ireland. What did it matter if they were part of a club that allowed people to travel, work and reside anywhere? North-south institutions were set up to oversee common endeavours. The agreement was sold as a “stepping stone to a united Ireland” to republicans, while unionists held that it was “securing the union”. The symbolism was key: with a hard border you can see that the island is partitioned, without it you cannot.Aware of this, London and Dublin committed not to return to the days of border checkpoints, which would risk undermining the peace deal’s principles. Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement enshrines this in law in the form of an insurance policy: to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal, there would be a backstop arrangement to allow for frictionless trade. Fanatical rightwing anti-EU Tory MPs were not bothered about the peace process, or the aspirations of fellow subjects. Instead, they saw in the insurance policy a devious mechanism to force Britain to march in lockstep with EU regulations that hard Brexiters were desperate to get out of. To reverse her government’s historic Commons defeat, Mrs May voted to replace the backstop. She did so to win over the Democratic Unionist party, but her actions enraged businesses in Northern Ireland which had publicly backed her deal.In Belfast on Tuesday, the prime minister was back to the push-me-pull-you politics of Brexit. She signalled that, rather than the “alternative arrangements” to the backstop floated previously, she was edging towards an insurance policy that could either be time-limited or allow for a unilateral withdrawal. The prime minister may have said more than she intended, as a group of her MPs considering “alternative arrangements” were meeting in London as she spoke. Neither of Mrs May’s offers seem possible in a strictly legal sense, but both could be rendered in political terms. Almost everyone agrees that the backstop must be a temporary measure, but no one wants to say so in law. On such anvils, political follies can be forged. Mrs May’s problem stems from the fact that the only Northern Ireland party represented in the Commons is the DUP. The party’s role in itself undermines a core principle of the Good Friday agreement, that the position of the British government would be “neutral” – it had no selfish, strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland and would accept the unification of Ireland by consent. The DUP-Conservative pact, a result of the 2017 election, calls this aspect into question. The DUP represents only a third of Northern Irish votes cast in 2017.Even more glaring is that Northern Ireland voted to remain. Unionism risks defeating itself if it becomes too closely identified with Brexit. Belatedly, Mrs May’s ministers have woken up to the democratic deficit in Northern Ireland and called for the restoration of Stormont. These islands are sold as a story of stability. Political scientist Roger Awan-Scully says history would differ. Less than a century ago, the UK lost a greater proportion of its territory – through Irish independence – than Germany had lost in the treaty of Versailles. In 2014, close to half of Scotland voted for independence. Fragmentation is by no means inevitable, but without a sense of common purpose and community it becomes more and more a possibility.• This article was amended on 6 February 2019 to change “The DUP represents only a third of votes cast in 2017” to “The DUP represents only a third of Northern Irish votes cast in 2017”.",The Guardian view on Brexit and Ireland: the forging of folly,2019-02-05/18:54:03+0000,brexit is about drawing lines on maps and hearts in that respect it is at odds with the  good friday agreement which sought to erase them key to ending the troubles was the removal of the hard border between the north and south of ireland theresa may s problem is that she has committed to leaving the european union while respecting the peace deal that depended on both london and dublin being part of it the agreement made less salient the questions of identity under its provisions people in northern ireland could be uncontroversially citizens of britain or ireland what did it matter if they were part of a club that allowed people to travel work and reside anywhere north south institutions were set up to oversee common endeavours the agreement was sold as a stepping stone to a united ireland to republicans while unionists held that it was securing the union the symbolism was key with a hard border you can see that the island is partitioned without it you cannot aware of this london and dublin committed not to return to the days of border checkpoints which would risk undermining the peace deal s principles mrs may s withdrawal agreement enshrines this in law in the form of an insurance policy to maintain an open border on the island of ireland in the event that the uk leaves the eu without securing an all encompassing deal there would be a backstop arrangement to allow for frictionless trade fanatical rightwing anti eu tory mps were not bothered about the peace process or the aspirations of fellow subjects instead they saw in the insurance policy a devious mechanism to force britain to march in lockstep with eu regulations that hard brexiters were desperate to get out of to reverse her government s historic commons defeat mrs may voted to replace the backstop she did so to win over the democratic unionist party but her actions enraged businesses in northern ireland which had publicly backed her deal in belfast on tuesday the prime minister was back to the push me pull you politics of brexit she signalled that rather than the alternative arrangements to the backstop floated previously she was edging towards an insurance policy that could either be time limited or allow for a unilateral withdrawal the prime minister may have said more than she intended as a group of her mps considering alternative arrangements were meeting in london as she spoke neither of mrs may s offers seem possible in a strictly legal sense but both could be rendered in political terms almost everyone agrees that the backstop must be a temporary measure but no one wants to say so in law on such anvils political follies can be forged mrs may s problem stems from the fact that the only northern ireland party represented in the commons is the dup the party s role in itself undermines a core principle of the good friday agreement that the position of the british government would be neutral it had no selfish strategic or economic interest in northern ireland and would accept the unification of ireland by consent the dup conservative pact a result of the  election calls this aspect into question the dup represents only a third of northern irish votes cast in  even more glaring is that northern ireland voted to remain unionism risks defeating itself if it becomes too closely identified with brexit belatedly mrs may s ministers have woken up to the democratic deficit in northern ireland and called for the restoration of stormont these islands are sold as a story of stability political scientist roger awan scully says history would differ less than a century ago the uk lost a greater proportion of its territory through irish independence than germany had lost in the treaty of versailles in  close to half of scotland voted for independence fragmentation is by no means inevitable but without a sense of common purpose and community it becomes more and more a possibility this article was amended on  february  to change the dup represents only a third of votes cast in  to the dup represents only a third of northern irish votes cast in  ,Brexit,0.2543402314186096
5263,"Ireland is in talks with the EU over a substantial Brexit emergency fund to offset the damage caused to the country’s €4.5bn (£3.96bn) food exports to Britain if the UK crashes out of the bloc with no deal next month.As Theresa May prepares for a crunch meeting in Brussels on Thursday, officials at the European commission are already looking at continuous compensatory measures for Ireland as part of an ongoing arrangement that could last years.Contingency funds to compensate farmers have already been discussed at the highest levels and are expected to arise in talks with the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, during a round of meetings in Brussels on Wednesday.Sources say Ireland will be looking for a “long-term fix” in EU budget talks in April rather than a lump sum Brexit bailout.Politicians have cited the ongoing assistance given to the Baltic states after Russia banned certain food exports from the EU as an example of financial solidarity it hopes to win in a no-deal Brexit.Ireland exports €4.5bn worth of food and drink a year to the UK, ranging from beef to cheddar cheese. Calculations by the Department of Agriculture put the cost of tariffs under World Trade Organization rules at €1.7bn.Michael Creed, Ireland’s minister for agriculture, food and the marine, has said this would be an “existential challenge” for the food and drink sector. He has previously said Ireland would seek “mega-money” from the EU.The beef industry alone could face increased costs of up to €700m, which the head of the Irish Farmers Association has said has the potential to wipe out beef production in the country.There are also concerns if Britain flips the other way and adopts a zero-tariffs policy, as this could result in cheaper chicken, beef and lamb from the US and South America displacing both British and Irish cuts from shop shelves.Creed has already talked of the European commission’s “readiness to respond to that crisis should it develop in the context of a crash out”.Informed sources say that ongoing assistance over many years will be the preferred option rather than a lump sum in a Brexit “bailout”.“Flexibility on state aid rules may be one we look for, but any fix is likely to come in the European budget discussions, which start in April, because a no-deal Brexit will have an ongoing impact and will be unpredictable,” said a source referring to the negotiations for the next EU financial cycle of 2020 to 2027.While Brexit is unprecedented, the assistance given to the Baltic states after Russia banned European food exports has been cited as a model for Ireland.Exports from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to Russia dropped by €5.8bn since 2014 and are still being supported by the EU.Creed has said Ireland’s ambition is to “ride out the difficulty” and “retain a foothold” in the UK with early engagement with the European commission in terms of “the need for aid, particularly exceptional aid on the beef side and also exchequer response”.He added that he would also be looking for “flexibility” in state aid rules to allow the Irish government to intervene.Sources in the European commission say they have not come to a view yet but “clearly there will be sympathy and understanding”.A spokesman for the commissioner for agriculture and rural development confirmed they had “explored the ways in which the EU could help Ireland and Irish businesses”.“There are possibilities under the Common Market Organisation which, for example, were used in response to the Russian ban and the subsequent dairy crisis. There are also possibilities under state aid rules, which have also been discussed.”Those working on Brexit preparedness at InterTradeIreland, an organisation set up under the Good Friday Agreement to help build cross-border business, say an area of particular concern is the impact a hard Brexit may have on ”micro-businesses” with fewer than 10 people. In Northern Ireland 3,800 micro firms, employing 13,000 people, regularly trade across the border.They have found 7,500 SMEs north of the border and “double that” south of the border that trade on both sides.Eight in 10 of micro businesses north of the border export exclusively to Ireland and few have any experience of filling out customs declarations forms or understanding tariff regimes.“They are the ones most likely to be affected by barriers to market access,” said Kerry Curran, policy research manager, as they are likely to be trading within supply chains and “also have less capacity to absorb the cost” of the extra administrative burden.",Ireland and EU discuss emergency funds to offset no-deal Brexit,2019-02-05/18:52:01+0000,ireland is in talks with the eu over a substantial brexit

5508,"European governments have said Britain must swiftly spell out its proposed Irish backstop alternatives and insisted the Brexit divorce deal cannot be revisited, as the continent’s media and commentators condemned Theresa May as weak and untrustworthy.Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said on Wednesday that London had “not yet said what changes to the backstop it envisages. It must now say quickly what it wants because time is running out.” The EU was ready to talk, he added, but “our position is clear: the agreement is the best and only solution for an orderly exit”.The German economic affairs ministry cited fear of a chaotic Brexit as one reason for slashing its 2018 economic growth forecast from 1.8% to 1%, while the country’s BDI industry association said it was “very difficult” for German companies to see London was “further playing with valuable time” ahead of Brexit day on 29 March.The UK parliament on Tuesday instructed May to seek changes from the EU27 to the withdrawal agreement she concluded with the EU last November. The bloc has said repeatedly that the deal could not be reopened.France’s Europe minister, Nathalie Loiseau, said time was running out. “We are ready to talk about the future, but now is the time to agree on the conditions of separation,” she said. “The withdrawal agreement on the table is the best possible agreement. Let’s not reopen it.”The office of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, noted in a statement that the agreement had been adopted jointly by the British government and the EU27. “This cannot be renegotiated,” it said. “The EU has been clear on this point.”The statement added that if the UK wanted to discuss the future UK-EU relationship, the EU was “open to that, with respect for its interests and values”. Britain must in any case now “clarify its intentions and make credible proposals”.Romania’s minister for European affairs, George Ciamba, told the Guardian that it was “a measure of the mistrust that you have in Britain” that the backstop had become such a sticking point for British MPs: “We didn’t think for one second that the backstop is there forever. Nobody wants to transform this into a hostage relationship.”Romania holds the rotating EU presidency and hosts an informal meeting of foreign ministers this week. Ciamba ruled out reopening the agreement but said he was still optimistic a deal could be reached. “It’s a political exercise and everyone has to save face, but I don’t think this is the end of the story,” he said.The Portuguese foreign minister, Augusto Santos Silva, said the EU was “ready to listen and give our position”, but only if Britain asked for an extension to the article 50 talks in order to present the bloc with “alternatives to its Brexit red lines, and clear alternatives to the backstop”.Margot Wallström, Sweden’s foreign minister, said she “cannot forgive” the British government’s “dangerous … and badly handled” approach to Brexit, adding: “I just think they’ve made such a historical mistake. They’ve really created a problem for all of us.”The European media was equally damning, accusing the prime minister of putting party before country. “To avoid the disintegration of her own Conservative party, Theresa May is now risking a major showdown with the EU,” wrote the French paper Le Monde’s London correspondent, Philippe Bernard.“Two months before the divorce date, she hopes to question two years of discussions with the EU27 – ditching her own handiwork.” British MPs sent two contradictory messages, the paper said: “One majority rejected no deal; another mandated May to begin a renegotiation so hypothetical as to risk a no deal.”As for the prime minister, she made her strategy very clear: “As risky as it is, she intends to run down the clock so as to force the EU27 into making concessions before 29 March. And then, if necessary, blame the EU – an easy scapegoat – for eventual failure.”In Germany, Björn Finke in the Süddeutsche Zeitung said the best way forward for May would undoubtedly be to approach Labour with concessions on a permanent customs union. “But that would lose her the support of hardcore Brexiteers in her own party, and risk splitting the Conservatives,” he said.“Since May lacks the courage and the leadership to take such a step, she prefers the seemingly simpler way: renegotiation. Brussels cannot trust her promise to win a majority if changes are made to the deal. May does not have her own party under control. May’s weakness is dangerous, for Britain and for the rest of the EU.”In an opinion piece for El País attacking May’s “startling disloyalty”, Xavier Vidal-Folch said bluntly the British prime minister “can no longer be trusted. Not because her judgment and arguments lack depth, but because she changes them at every step.”It is true that this “worries the Europeans”, Vidal-Folch said. “That’s why they’re drawing up contingency plans, which only remind them of the losses ahead. But those who’ll suffer the most damage are the British themselves.“The car industry, banks and technology sector are all putting the finishing touches to their own partial or total ex-Brit plans. It’s not abstract markets that will tip the balance, but real businesses, inventors, professionals and doctors. Because May can no longer be trusted.”NRC Handelsblad in the Netherlands was equally brutal. “To save her Brexit deal, avoid a split in her party and retain the minimum of control a prime minister needs, May aims to provoke a conflict with the EU,” it said.“What has not proved possible in the past two years now has to be sorted in a fortnight, before the next parliamentary vote … The job looks impossible. The moment of truth approaches for British politics.”","Show us your backstop alternatives, EU governments tell May",2019-01-30/10:36:10+0000,european governments have said britain must swiftly spell

This is the order in which they were taken:A: LabourO: the SNPG: Dominic GrieveB: Yvette CooperJ: Rachel ReevesI: Caroline SpelmanN: Graham BradyAmendment defeated by 327 votes to 296, a majority of 31.Tabled by Jeremy Corbyn and backed by a series of frontbenchers, this pushes the party policy of avoiding no deal and instead seeking a form of customs union.Amendment defeated by 321 votes to 298, a majority of 23.One of the most closely scrutinised amendments, and backed by more than 70 MPs, this would guarantee parliamentary time for a private members’ bill drafted by Cooper that would extend article 50 to the end of 2019 if Theresa May failed to secure a deal by late February. While it seems likely to win official Labour backing, and from some Tories, it could be scuppered by doubts among Labour MPs in leave-voting areas. The government will whip MPs against backing it.Amendment defeated by 321 votes to 301, a majority of 20.This idea by the former attorney general would allow parliament to take control in creating a series of indicative votes by decreeing that a motion put forward by a minority of 300 MPs from at least five parties – including 10 Tory MPs – would be debated as the first item for MPs in the Commons the next day.Amendment passed by 318 votes to 310, a majority of eight.Tabled by the longstanding Tory MP and former environment minister Caroline Spelman, with the backing of more than 115 MPs from various parties, this states that the UK will not leave the EU without a deal. It is only advisory and has no legislative force.Amendment defeated by 322 votes to 290, a majority of 32.Signed by a cross-party group of remain-minded MPs, led by Labour’s Rachel Reeves, this would seek a two-year extension of article 50 if there is not a deal in place by 26 February.Amendment passed by 317 votes to 301, a majority of 16.Its figurehead is Graham Brady, who as chair of the 1922 Committee is the voice of Tory backbenchers. Yet another attempt at making the backstop more palatable to Tory MPs, this says it should be “replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”. Once again, this is something the EU has ruled out. The government has indicated that it will whip MPs to back the amendment, which if passed would allow May to go to Brussels with a clear sign from MPs of what they want, to get a deal through parliament.Amendment defeated by 327 votes to 39, a majority of 288.This notes that the Scottish and Welsh assemblies also “voted overwhelmingly to reject the prime minister’s deal”, calling for an extension of article 50 and no deal being removed as an option.Amendments not selected or withdrawn:These all called, in various ways, for a second EU referendum. Three amendments-to-the-amendment were tabled by Labour backbenchers, and two by the Liberal Democrats. The Lib Dems also tabled a separate amendment on the subject.This would have created a committee of no more than 17 MPs based on representation in the Commons to lead on all Brexit matters in parliament.Tabled again by the Conservative backbencher Andrew Murrison, and backed by more than 30 other Tories, this would have decreed that the Irish backstop, if it came into force, would expire at the end of 2021 – something the EU has said it will not agree to. Withdrawn to improve the chances of support for Brady’s amendment.This would have called for a series of non-binding indicative votes in parliament to determine the way forward.

representative but randomly selected group, to devise possible ways to move forward on Brexit.These said that MPs would not back a withdrawal agreement including a backstop with variations calling for it to be permitted only if it expires after six months or if it contains a right of unilateral UK withdrawal (M).Tabled by the Brexit-backing former Labour MP Frank Field but supported by remainers including Ken Clarke, this called for non-binding MPs’ votes on areas including the backstop, various trade deals, and another referendum.Put forward by two SNP MPs, Angus Brendan MacNeil and Pete

5565,"Labour was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on Monday over the government’s flagship immigration bill, after initially saying it would not oppose the legislation that brings free movement to an end.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, had sparked a backlash among MPs when she told the House of Commons that the frontbench would not vote against the post-Brexit legislation.“The Labour party is clear that when Britain leaves the single market, freedom of movement ends, and we set this out in our 2017 manifesto. I am a slavish devotee of that magnificent document: so on that basis, the frontbench of the Labour party will not be opposing this bill this evening,” she said.She added that Labour would abstain at this stage, known as second reading, and seek amendments later.Abbott then tweeted that the bill put “the cart before the horse” because it seeks to establish a new immigration regime before the UK’s future relationship with the EU has been settled. “Labour wants to amend bill substantially. Today isn’t a final vote!” she added.But 90 minutes later, amid a growing backlash on social media, Labour shifted its position and announced that it would whip its MPs to vote against the bill – though many had been told by the whips that they did not need to be present in Westminster on Monday.Despite Labour’s change of heart, the government won the vote by 297 votes to 234, a comfortable majority of 63. With only a one-line whip in force, many of Labour’s 256 MPs had permission to be absent, and just 178 were present for the late-night vote.The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Ed Davey, accused Labour of missing a potential opportunity to defeat the government, pointing out that two Conservative MPs, Anna Soubry and Ken Clarke, had rebelled.“It is beyond belief that some Tory MPs were more organised on opposing the government’s hostile immigration policies than the Labour shadow cabinet,” he said.One usually loyal backbench Labour MP described his party leadership’s flip-flop on the bill as a “meltdown”, adding: “Anyone with one foot on the ground could have told you the optics of the abstention, given Brexit sensitivities, was shocking.”Several Labour backbenchers, including Chris Leslie and Angela Smith, had intervened to press Abbott, a longtime defender of immigration, on whether MPs would be whipped to oppose the bill – and signalled that they planned to rebel and vote against it.Theresa May has repeatedly said that her Brexit deal will bring freedom of movement for EU citizens to an end, and that the immigration bill will establish the new, stricter regime.Abbott had fiercely criticised the legislation as MPs debated it on Monday, calling it “one of the flimsiest pieces of legislation on a major issue that I or many of my colleagues have seen”. “This bill, the immigration white paper and the accompanying media narrative, plays to some of the very worst aspects of the Brexit debate. In the process, it risks doing irreparable damage to business, the economy and society,” she said.Immigration is at the heart of Labour’s internal tussle over how to respond to the referendum result of June 2016. Some MPs, particularly in leave-voting constituencies, believe Labour has little choice but to accede to the demands of voters who want to see controls on immigration – a phrase Ed Miliband was criticised for plastering on mugs during the 2015 general election campaign.Other Labour MPs, including the chair of the centrist group Progress, Alison McGovern, believe their party should be making the argument strongly for the benefits of immigration.The Tory MP Ken Clarke said of Abbott: “She’s actually been making an extremely coherent root-and-branch criticism of the bill, and she has an excellent record on these things; but the problem is, we’re meant to be debating whether this House of Commons will approve the second reading of the bill.“She’s denouncing it from beginning to end, but is saying the opposition don’t intend to vote against it. This makes the proceedings quite absurd.”",Labour makes abrupt U-turn over immigration bill vote,2019-01-28/20:12:21+0000,labour was forced into an embarrassing u turn on monday over the government s flagship immigration bill after initially saying it would not oppose the legislation that brings free movement to an end the shadow home secretary diane abbott had sparked a backlash among mps when she told the house of commons that the frontbench would not vote against the post brexit legislation the labour party is clear that when britain leaves the single market freedom of movement ends and we set this out in our  manifesto i am a slavish devotee of that magnificent document so on that basis the frontbench of the labour party will not be opposing this bill this evening she said she added that labour would abstain at this stage known as second reading and seek amendments later abbott then tweeted that the bill put the cart before the horse because it seeks to establish a new immigration regime before the uk s future relationship with the eu has been settled labour wants to amend bill substantially today isn t a final vote she added but  minutes later amid a growing backlash on social media labour shifted its position and announced that it would whip its mps to vote against the bill though many had been told by the whips that they did not need to be present in westminster on monday despite labour s change of heart the government won the vote by  votes to  a comfortable majority of  with only a one line whip in force many of labour s  mps had permission to be absent and just  were present for the late night vote the liberal democrat home affairs spokesman ed davey accused labour of missing a potential opportunity to defeat the government pointing out that two conservative mps anna soubry and ken clarke had rebelled it is beyond belief that some tory mps were more organised on opposing the government s hostile immigration policies than the labour shadow cabinet he said one usually loyal backbench labour mp described his party leadership s flip flop on the bill as a meltdown adding anyone with one foot on the ground could have told you the optics of the abstention given brexit sensitivities was shocking several labour backbenchers including chris leslie and angela smith had intervened to press abbott a longtime defender of immigration on whether mps would be whipped to oppose the bill and signalled that they planned to rebel and vote against it theresa may has repeatedly said that her brexit deal will bring freedom of movement for eu citizens to an end and that the immigration bill will establish the new stricter regime abbott had fiercely criticised the legislation as mps debated it on monday calling it one of the flimsiest pieces of legislation on a major issue that i or many of my colleagues have seen this bill the immigration white paper and the accompanying media narrative plays to some of the very worst aspects of the brexit debate in the process it risks doing irreparable damage to business the economy and society she said immigration is at the heart of labour s internal tussle over how to respond to the referendum result of june  some mps particularly in leave voting constituencies believe labour has little choice but to accede to the demands of voters who want to see controls on immigration a phrase ed miliband was criticised for plastering on mugs during the  general election campaign other labour mps including the chair of the centrist group progress alison mcgovern believe their party should be making the argument strongly for the benefits of immigration the tory mp ken clarke said of abbott she s actually been making an extremely coherent root and branch criticism of the bill and she has an excellent record on these things but the problem is we re meant to be debating whether this house of commons will approve the second reading of the bill she s denouncing it from beginning to end but is saying the opposition don t intend to vote against it this makes the proceedings quite absurd ,Brexit,0.17527709901332855
5576,"Scottish ministers are rushing through dozens of urgent legislative changes in an last-minute effort to protect Scottish businesses and consumers from a no-deal Brexit.The Scottish government has identified 36 legislative measures it believes are critical and must be in place before 29 March to ensure devolved areas such as farming, fisheries, food safety, the environment, animal welfare and forestry are protected if the UK crashes out of the EU.Officials and party business managers at Holyrood are preparing to order late parliamentary sittings, cancelling non-essential debates or votes and holding extra committee hearings to sit at the same time as parliament is in session to help cope with the surge in work.Mike Russell, Scotland’s secretary for constitutional affairs, said his government had a duty to prepare for Brexit and was redeploying staff to do so.“We share the frustrations of businesses, communities and individuals across the country that we are being forced to prepare for a range of uncertain and unknown scenarios, diverting resources away from other areas, as we leave the EU against the wishes of the majority of Scots,” he said.The former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has estimated the Scottish government’s preparations for Brexit will cost nearly £100m by April 2020, including planning for a no-deal scenario.“The future total figure could be considerably greater, this is all money that could have been invested in our struggling NHS, schools or rail services,” Dugdale said.Quitting the EU means hundreds of pieces of legislation need to be amended to ensure laws in force across the UK and devolved nations are updated to guarantee the same legal standards and protections in place now are in force after Brexit.Most of those changes are being pushed through Westminster, Holyrood and the Welsh assembly using statutory instruments, a type of secondary legislation that can be introduced without passing a new act. In some cases changes to different laws will be bundled up into one statutory instrument, and in some high-priority cases they require a parliamentary vote to agree them.Despite last year’s legal battle between the UK and Scottish governments over Holyrood’s emergency Brexit legislation, known as the continuity bill, Scottish and UK civil servants have agreed to share the workload in updating the affected laws.Whitehall has already written and overseen a large majority of the statutory instruments that affect Scottish legislation before sending those to Holyrood for formal approval under UK-wide “common frameworks”.By 23 January, 105 UK-wide statutory instruments had been passed by MSPs, covering areas such as nuclear safety, genetically modified foods, tobacco controls, greenhouse gas emissions trading, gender equality, renewable energy, organ transplants and food safety.However, that leaves scores of changes for Scottish ministers to oversee using Scottish statutory instruments (SSIs). In addition to the 36 critical measures that Holyrood needs to process before 29 March, dozens of other SSIs will need to be approved after Brexit day.Scottish ministers are cautious about disclosing the titles of these measures before they are tabled, citing the need to observe the protocol that parliament should be told first.Russell is meanwhile in talks with opposition parties about when and whether to table an amended continuity bill. The UK supreme court ruled in December that the continuity bill was unlawful, in large part because the UK government altered Holyrood’s legal powers after it had been introduced, stopping it being enacted in its current form.He would not be drawn on what would happen next, but legal sources say they believe its fate hangs on what happens with Brexit at Westminster.Opposition MSPs suspect Russell plans to table new farming and fisheries bills after Brexit, which could cause friction with UK legislation being proposed by Michael Gove, the environment secretary.",Scotland hurries legislation to protect against no-deal Brexit,2019-01-28/16:36:13+0000,scottish ministers are rushing through dozens of urgent legislative changes in an last minute effort to protect scottish businesses and consumers from a no deal brexit the scottish government has identified  legislative measures it believes are critical and must be in place before  march to ensure devolved areas such as farming fisheries food safety the environment animal welfare and forestry are protected if the uk crashes out of the eu officials and party business managers at holyrood are preparing to order late parliamentary sittings cancelling non essential debates or votes and holding extra committee hearings to sit at the same time as parliament is in session to help cope with the surge in work mike russell scotland s secretary for constitutional affairs said his government had a duty to prepare for brexit and was redeploying staff to do so we share the frustrations of businesses communities and individuals across the country that we are being forced to prepare for a range of uncertain and unknown scenarios diverting resources away from other areas as we leave the eu against the wishes of the majority of scots he said the former scottish labour leader kezia dugdale has estimated the scottish government s preparations for brexit will cost nearly m by april  including planning for a no deal scenario the future total figure could be considerably greater this is all money that could have been invested in our struggling nhs schools or rail services dugdale said quitting the eu means hundreds of pieces of legislation need to be amended to ensure laws in force across the uk and devolved nations are updated to guarantee the same legal standards and protections in place now are in force after brexit most of those changes are being pushed through westminster holyrood and the welsh assembly using statutory instruments a type of secondary legislation that can be introduced without passing a new act in some cases changes to different laws will be bundled up into one statutory instrument and in some high priority cases they require a parliamentary vote to agree them despite last year s legal battle between the uk and scottish governments over holyrood s emergency brexit legislation known as the continuity bill scottish and uk civil servants have agreed to share the workload in updating the affected laws whitehall has already written and overseen a large majority of the statutory instruments that affect scottish legislation before sending those to holyrood for formal approval under uk wide common frameworks by  january  uk wide statutory instruments had been passed by msps covering areas such as nuclear safety genetically modified foods tobacco controls greenhouse gas emissions trading gender equality renewable energy organ transplants and food safety however that leaves scores of changes for scottish ministers to oversee using scottish statutory instruments ssis in addition to the  critical measures that holyrood needs to process before  march dozens of other ssis will need to be approved after brexit day scottish ministers are cautious about disclosing the titles of these measures before they are tabled citing the need to observe the protocol that parliament should be told first russell is meanwhile in talks with opposition parties about when and whether to table an amended continuity bill the uk supreme court ruled in december that the continuity bill was unlawful in large part because the uk government altered holyrood s legal powers after it had been introduced stopping it being enacted in its current form he would not be drawn on what would happen next but legal sources say they believe its fate hangs on what happens with brexit at westminster opposition msps suspect russell plans to table new farming and fisheries bills after brexit which could cause friction with uk legislation being proposed by michael gove the environment secretary ,Brexit,0.20298339426517487
5609,"Ireland has launched a last-minute effort to warn Theresa May off any attempt to unravel the backstop, two days before a crucial Commons debate that may decide the next move for the UK’s rudderless Brexit policy.Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister and deputy prime minister, insisted the backstop – the mechanism to ensure there will be no hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland if Britain and the EU fail to strike a free trade deal – was “part of a balanced package that isn’t going to change”. In a forceful interview, he insisted it was only part of the withdrawal agreement because of the UK’s red lines.On Tuesday Tory Brexiters may get the chance to vote for amendments that would signal their willingness to back May’s Brexit deal subject to the backstop’s either being removed or time-limited.Ministers have not formally backed any of the anti-backstop amendments, which are incompatible with the deal that May agreed with UK leaders, but if one were to pass by a majority, she would be able to present the EU with a firm idea of what changes might get her deal through parliament – something that as yet remains unclear to Brussels.MPs pushing the anti-backstop amendments will be competing against a rival bloc of parliamentarians hoping to get a majority for an amendment intended to prevent the government taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. Various versions of this are on the order paper, including some viewed with alarm by ministers because they cede control of the parliamentary timetable to backbenchers.Last week there were reports claiming that dozens of pro-European ministers might resign if ordered to vote against the most robust anti no-deal amendment, tabled by Labour’s Yvette Cooper.Those threats seem to have faded but, according to the Telegraph, pro-European ministers, including the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the justice secretary, David Gauke, held a conference call on Sunday night during which some of them said that the threat to resign could be reactivated if May did not bring a new deal back for a parliamentary vote within a fortnight. They fear that, if May is allowed to delay beyond the middle of February, a no-deal Brexit could become inevitable. In an interview with BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show, Coveney said he did not see the need for further compromise because “the backstop is already a compromise”. Although originally Northern Ireland-specific, it was made UK-wide at the request of May, he said.“And the very need for the backstop in the first place was because of British red lines that they wanted to leave the customs union and single market,” he said.“So the Irish position is, look, we have already agreed to a series of compromises here, and that has resulted in what is proposed in the withdrawal agreement. Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, when we say that the backstop, as part of the withdrawal agreement, is part of a balanced package that isn’t going to change.”Ireland has repeatedly stressed its commitment to retaining the backstop. But since May’s deal was rejected this month in the Commons by an unprecedented majority of 230, some ministers claim to have picked up signs that other members of the EU may be inclined to compromise on this in order to avert a no-deal Brexit.Responding to Coveney’s interview, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, dismissed suggestions it had sabotaged May’s Brexit strategy for the coming week, saying all sides were looking for “pragmatic solutions” to the Irish border problem.Hancock also played down a report claiming that, as part of government planning for a no-deal Brexit, officials had been looking at the possible need to introduce martial law to cope with civil disorder. Under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, sweeping powers are available to the government for use in emergencies, but Hancock said that, while governments have to look at all options, martial law was “not specifically” being looked at.In a further development on Monday the Commons Brexit committee published a report suggesting that the government was being too complacent about how the negative consequences of a no-deal Brexit might be contained.“While the EU might agree to side deals to mitigate the worst of the disruption of a no-deal outcome, this cannot be guaranteed, and we are concerned by the extent to which assumptions of an ongoing cooperative relationship underpin the government’s no-deal planning,” said the report, which was approved by a majority of the committee after five Brexiter members voted against.“Since these assumptions cannot be guaranteed, a ‘managed no deal’ cannot constitute the policy of any responsible government,” the report went on.Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: “Having taken a wide range of evidence on the implications of a no-deal Brexit, the committee is clear that this cannot be allowed to happen.“It would disrupt supply chains, create costs and uncertainty for businesses, threaten the reintroduction of tariffs and new non-tariff barriers which would affect competitiveness and many small businesses are not ready because they don’t know what to plan for.”",Blow for May as Ireland stresses it will not yield on Brexit backstop,2019-01-28/00:00:05+0000,ireland has launched a last minute

5662,"French businesses working with British contractors or suppliers should now be actively seeking out alternatives, the French government has said, as it further ramped up preparations for a no-deal Brexit that it sees as increasingly likely.“Let’s not panic, but let’s prepare for different scenarios,” the Europe minister, Nathalie Loiseau, said on Friday as she unveiled a 28-page booklet for companies with British ties, which advises them to adopt the UK’s wartime motto and “keep calm and carry on”.Companies reliant on UK business partners should explore other options outside Britain, while those with UK-based operations in specific EU-regulated sectors such as pharmaceuticals should think about moving them to the continent, the guidance saysLast week France triggered a €50m (£44m) plan for no-deal after the UK parliament overwhelmingly rejected Theresa May’s proposed deal. The French prime minister, Edouard Philippe, said there were now “strong fears” that Britain could crash out of the EU without a deal on 29 March.The government authorised new infrastructure spending on border checkpoints, roads, lorry parks and warehousing at ports and airports and is hiring 750 extra staff, including customs officials and veterinary and standards inspectors, to carry out checks on goods, livestock and food products.Agnès Pannier-Runacher, the junior economy and finance minister, said on Friday that France was “hoping for the best but planning for the worst”, and that no-deal would plunge the country into an “unprecedented situation with a major trading partner”.The risk of no deal had “significantly increased”, she said. “There is absolutely no time left to lose for these companies. The countdown has well and truly started.”The booklet says French firms with financial services contracts in the UK should think about switching them to an EU27 country and consider what to do with confidential data currently stored in Britain. Those with UK-based employees should start thinking about possible social security issues and consider hiring temporary staff. It also suggests that French companies working with UK partners on programmes funded by the EU should start searching elsewhere for collaborators.As many as 30,000 French companies export to the UK, and 3,300 have British-based operations, according to government figures. French officials plan to hold around 30 meetings around the country to help small businesses in particular prepare for all possible forms of Brexit.Loiseau said Paris would of course be looking for a “close and mutually beneficial” relationship with Britain after Brexit, but deal or no deal, it would necessarily be one that was “downgraded” from its current status.“There is no relationship more simple, more profitable, more complete – between businesses, between citizens – than being a member of the European Union,” she said.",French firms with UK ties told to look for alternatives as Brexit looms,2019-01-25/19:30:36+0000,french businesses working with british contractors or suppliers should now be actively seeking out alternatives the french government has said as it further ramped up preparations for a no deal brexit that it sees as increasingly likely let s not panic but let s prepare for different scenarios the europe minister nathalie loiseau said on friday as she unveiled a  page booklet for companies with british ties which advises them to adopt the uk s wartime motto and keep calm and carry on companies reliant on uk business partners should explore other options outside britain while those with uk based operations in specific eu regulated sectors such as pharmaceuticals should think about moving them to the continent the guidance sayslast week france triggered a m m plan for no deal after the uk parliament overwhelmingly rejected theresa may s proposed deal the french prime minister edouard philippe said there were now strong fears that britain could crash out of the eu without a deal on  march the government authorised new infrastructure spending on border checkpoints roads lorry parks and warehousing at ports and airports and is hiring  extra staff including customs officials and veterinary and standards inspectors to carry out checks on goods livestock and food products agnès pannier runacher the junior economy and finance minister said on friday that france was hoping for the best but planning for the worst and that no deal would plunge the country into an unprecedented situation with a major trading partner the risk of no deal had significantly increased she said there is absolutely no time left to lose for these companies the countdown has well and truly started the booklet says french firms with financial services contracts in the uk should think about switching them to an eu country and consider what to do with confidential data currently stored in britain those with uk based employees should start thinking about possible social security issues and consider hiring temporary staff it also suggests that french companies working with uk partners on programmes funded by the eu should start searching elsewhere for collaborators as many as   french companies export to the uk and   have british based operations according to government figures french officials plan to hold around  meetings around the country to help small businesses in particular prepare for all possible forms of brexit loiseau said paris would of course be looking for a close and mutually beneficial relationship with britain after brexit but deal or no deal it would necessarily be one that was downgraded from its current status there is no relationship more simple more profitable more complete between businesses between citizens than being a member of the european union she said ,Brexit,0.21215428411960602
5766,"Ireland will have 400 new customs officers in place by the end of March as it rushes to put no-deal measures in place to keep trade moving with Great Britain, according to an unpublished document from the Irish tax authority.Niall Cody, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, will reveal the scale of no-deal contingency operations for the first time on Thursday, warning of the adverse impact for 70,000 Irish small to medium-sized businesses that trade with the UK.“We have accelerated and expanded our recruitment and training schedules to meet the end of March deadline [for Brexit],” he will tell a parliamentary committee.But the Republic says it will not be putting any customs posts on the border with Northern Ireland. “The government has made clear that the overriding objective is to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Revenue is not planning for customs post,” Cody will say.“The government has indicated that in the event of no deal, it will engage in intensive discussions with the EU commission and our EU partners will provide whatever technical expertise and assistance may be required during this process.”His comments come after the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said in the event of no deal the EU “will have to find an operational way of carrying out checks and controls without putting back in place a border”.It seemed to backpedal on earlier claims that no deal would lead to a hard border, raising questions about the lack of a clear definition of that term, and the absence of no-deal planning papers in the public domain from the UK, Ireland or the EU in relation to the most contentious issue in the Brexit deal.During 2017, 84,000 Irish businesses traded with the UK and about half of those, 45,000, were regular traders. Only 17,000 businesses in Ireland currently trade with third countries, requiring 1.6m customs import and export declarations to be processed.“Post Brexit, import and export declarations could increase to as many as 20m per annum,” Cody will say on Thursday. This is because the UK will be classified as a third country from 30 March in the event of a no deal.The Labour TD and former deputy prime minister of Ireland Joan Burton said this would spell chaos not just for Ireland but for the UK as well. “I think that finally we are being honest about what happens if the UK leaves the customs union and the free movement of goods ends until alternative arrangements are made,” she said.“If Ireland has to deal with 20m import and export declarations and we are a small country, just think of the number of import and export declarations the UK will have to cope with with France, the Netherlands, Germany, all 27 countries.”Burton said infrastructure on the Northern Ireland border was in “nobody’s interest including the unionist community”.",Ireland hires 400 new customs officials in case of no-deal Brexit,2019-01-23/19:47:07+0000,ireland will have  new customs officers in place by the end of march as it rushes to put no deal measures in place to keep trade moving with great britain according to an unpublished document from the irish tax authority niall cody the chairman of the revenue commissioners will reveal the scale of no deal contingency operations for the first time on thursday warning of the adverse impact for   irish small to medium sized businesses that trade with the uk we have accelerated and expanded our recruitment and training schedules to meet the end of march deadline for brexit he will tell a parliamentary committee but the republic says it will not be putting any customs posts on the border with northern ireland the government has made clear that the overriding objective is to avoid a hard border on the island of ireland revenue is not planning for customs post cody will say the government has indicated that in the event of no deal it will engage in intensive discussions with the eu commission and our eu partners will provide whatever technical expertise and assistance may be required during this process his comments come after the eu s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier said in the event of no deal the eu will have to find an operational way of carrying out checks and controls without putting back in place a border it seemed to backpedal on earlier claims that no deal would lead to a hard border raising questions about the lack of a clear definition of that term and the absence of no deal planning papers in the public domain from the uk ireland or the eu in relation to the most contentious issue in the brexit deal during    irish businesses traded with the uk and about half of those   were regular traders only   businesses in ireland currently trade with third countries requiring  m customs import and export declarations to be processed post brexit import and export declarations could increase to as many as m per annum cody will say on thursday this is because the uk will be classified as a third country from  march in the event of a no deal the labour td and former deputy prime minister of ireland joan burton said this would spell chaos not just for ireland but for the uk as well i think that finally we are being honest about what happens if the uk leaves the customs union and the free movement of goods ends until alternative arrangements are made she said if ireland has to deal with m import and export declarations and we are a small country just think of the number of import and export declarations the uk will have to cope with with france the netherlands germany all  countries burton said infrastructure on the northern ireland border was in nobody s interest including the unionist community ,Brexit,0.3026701509952545
5790,"Jeremy Corbyn has accused Theresa May of closing down solutions to the Brexit impasse by refusing to countenance customs union membership or to rule out no deal, saying these could command majority support in the Commons.Again using all his time at prime minister’s questions to focus on the stalled Brexit strategy, Corbyn argued that May’s promise to liaise with other parties was meaningless if she declined to abandon any of her red lines.“It appears that while the door to her office may be open, apparently the minds inside it are completely closed,” the Labour leader said, borrowing a line used by one of his MPs, Hilary Benn, earlier in the week.In response, May lambasted Corbyn for being the only opposition party leader to refuse to discuss Brexit with her in person, and mocked his demand for a future customs union with the EU as vague.Before a slightly subdued Commons, which has witnessed similar exchanges numerous times in recent weeks, Corbyn began by noting reported comments from the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to business leaders, reassuring them a no-deal departure would not happen.“So will the prime minister listen to her own cabinet members and take no deal off the table?” Corbyn asked.After arguing that the only way to rule out no deal was to pass her deal, May queried Corbyn’s decision to not join her for discussions: “The right honourable gentleman has been willing to sit down with Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA without preconditions, yet he won’t meet me to talk about Brexit.”Corbyn replied: “The only consistency in her strategy seems to be running down the clock on this by threatening no deal as an alternative to her dead deal.”In later exchanges about a post-Brexit customs union, which Labour wants, May declined explicitly to rule this out, but mainly because she answered Corbyn’s question by mocking what he said was Labour’s vagueness as to the details of this.“If he won’t talk about it there’s only one conclusion: he hasn’t got a clue,” she said. May added later: “The right honourable gentleman is doing what he always does: he just stands up, uses these phrases, and the honest answer is I don’t think he knows what those phrases mean or what the implications of those phrases are.”Corbyn said the government was in chaos over Brexit, highlighting the previous promise by Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, that dozens of new trade agreements would be in place “the second after Brexit”.He said: “Why is the prime minister prepared to sell people’s jobs and living standards down the river rather than negotiate a customs union that would be part of a sensible deal for the future?“While a third of her government are at the billionaires’ jamboree in Davos, she says she’s listening, but rules out changes on the two issues where there might be a majority – against no deal, and for a customs union, part of Labour’s sensible alternative.“If the prime minister is serious about finding a solution, which of her red lines is she prepared to abandon?

5853,"The Derry bombing this weekend is a stark reminder of what is at stake in Northern Ireland with Brexit: decades of peace where arguments are settled with words not weapons. In reopening the question of whether the physical border between the North and South of Ireland might return, Brexit threatens to turn back the clock to a far more dangerous era. That past, where symbols summon deadly emotions, has been revived by English nationalists in the Tory party who appear comfortably ignorant of the Troubles. Erasing the border in Ireland, once dotted with watchtowers and checkpoints, was necessary. But Brexit put the deadly issues of the Irish border and sovereignty back into mainstream debate. Dissident republicans have been blamed by the police for the van bomb attack on a Derry courthouse. Their ideological patrons have long recognised Brexit’s potential to reignite the conflict, with one quoted in academic Marisa McGlinchey’s new study Unfinished Business as saying it was “the best chance we’ve had since 1916”.That is why Theresa May and the European Union committed to avoiding the return of a “hard border” – physical checks or infrastructure – after Brexit. The UK and Ireland are currently part of the EU single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected. To maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal, Mrs May and the EU said it was necessary to have a backstop arrangement that will allow for frictionless trade. The trouble is that the Democratic Unionist party is divided over how to deal with this insurance policy. The party’s “blood red line” of no border down the Irish Sea means it could accept only the hardest or softest of Brexits. Hence Mrs May continues to talk to the DUP in the hope that the party will make up its mind.The prime minister ought to have realised months ago that the hard Brexit faction within the DUP has its power base in Westminster. It first asserted itself after power-sharing in Northern Ireland collapsed. It became dominant after Mrs May sought DUP support for her parliamentary majority in Westminster in the wake of the 2017 election. The suspended Stormont assembly provided a forum for sane debate: in August 2016 the DUP’s Arlene Foster signed a joint letter with Sinn Féin’s Martin McGuinness on safeguarding the gains of the peace process and the need to protect “the border [issue], the all-island energy market, EU peace funding and the need to maintain tariff- and barrier-free trade with the EU”.To win support for her deal, Mrs May must seek to revive such sentiments not just within Ms Foster’s party but also within the wider nationalist community. Efforts in this direction won’t be helped by former cabinet ministers ludicrously suggesting that Brexit would have been resolved if not for splits in the Irish government, or that the UK government should simply wait for the EU to dump Dublin in favour of London. The withdrawal agreement already has a provision for Britain to choose whether to enter the backstop or extend the transition. What Mrs May also needs to do urgently is win back the nationalist community and the growing band of Northern Irish non-tribal voters. Departing the EU could see Brexit become synonymous with defending the province’s place within the UK. The risk to unionism is voters could then reassess their constitutional preference. Few want a hard border; they should not block ways to avoid one. Electoral contingency and political expediency cannot be allowed to break up the UK.",The Guardian view on Brexit and Ireland: a danger to peace,2019-01-21/18:57:35+0000,the derry bombing this weekend is a stark reminder of what is at stake in northern ireland with brexit decades of peace where arguments are settled with words not weapons in reopening the question of whether the physical border between the north and south of ireland might return brexit threatens to turn back the clock to a far more dangerous era that past where symbols summon deadly emotions has been revived by english nationalists in the tory party who appear comfortably ignorant of the troubles erasing the border in ireland once dotted with watchtowers and checkpoints was necessary but brexit put the deadly issues of the irish border and sovereignty back into mainstream debate dissident republicans have been blamed by the police for the van bomb attack on a derry courthouse their ideological patrons have long recognised brexit s potential to reignite the conflict with one quoted in academic marisa mcglinchey s new study unfinished business as saying it was the best chance we ve had since  that is why theresa may and the european union committed to avoiding the return of a hard border physical checks or infrastructure after brexit the uk and ireland are currently part of the eu single market and customs union so products do not need to be inspected to maintain an open border on the island of ireland in the event that the uk leaves the eu without securing an all encompassing deal mrs may and the eu said it was necessary to have a backstop arrangement that will allow for frictionless trade the trouble is that the democratic unionist party is divided over how to deal with this insurance policy the party s blood red line of no border down the irish sea means it could accept only the hardest or softest of brexits hence mrs may continues to talk to the dup in the hope that the party will make up its mind the prime minister ought to have realised months ago that the hard brexit faction within the dup has its power base in westminster it first asserted itself after power sharing in northern ireland collapsed it became dominant after mrs may sought dup support for her parliamentary majority in westminster in the wake of the  election the suspended stormont assembly provided a forum for sane debate in august  the dup s arlene foster signed a joint letter with sinn féin s martin mcguinness on safeguarding the gains of the peace process and the need to protect the border issue the all island energy market eu peace funding and the need to maintain tariff and barrier free trade with the eu to win support for her deal mrs may must seek to revive such sentiments not just within ms foster s party but also within the wider nationalist community efforts in this direction won t be helped by former cabinet ministers ludicrously suggesting that brexit would have been resolved if not for splits in the irish government or that the uk government should simply wait for the eu to dump dublin in favour of london the withdrawal agreement already has a provision for britain to choose whether to enter the backstop or extend the transition what mrs may also needs to do urgently is win back the nationalist community and the growing band of northern irish non tribal voters departing the eu could see brexit become synonymous with defending the province s place within the uk the risk to unionism is voters could then reassess their constitutional preference few want a hard border they should not block ways to avoid one electoral contingency and political expediency cannot be allowed to break up the uk ,Brexit,0.2213028222322464
5875,"Work has begun at the Calais Eurotunnel exit for a new border inspection post for horses and other large animals as part of a £20m no-deal contingency plan.Controls are also being prepared at the nearby port of Boulogne to cater for the 200,000 tonnes of fish the UK exports through France.The plans are part of Brexit preparations launched by the French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, in Calais on Friday, in response to more than a year’s campaigning by the region’s president, Xavier Bertrand.Digging has already begun at Coquelles, the site of the Eurotunnel exit, with funds contributed by its parent company, Getlink.Ici, le 30 mars, il y aura un poste de contrôle douanier et vétérinaire en sortie de tunnel sous la manche. « C’est tendu, mais on est motivé » affirme Jacques Gounon, pdg d’eurotunnel. pic.twitter.com/kMBnv6neQcUnder EU rules, animals, fresh food and agri-feed from Britain will be classified as being from a “third country” post Brexit, with checks for disease, traceability, rules of origin and welfare mandatory on the French side.And although work has yet to start, land for a temporary border inspection post involving customs and sanitary checks has been commandeered at the Transmark fuel stop in Calais off the A16, the main artery between the town and Dunkirk.Planning for border operations on the British side of the Channel is less advanced because of the continuing uncertainty over the possibility of no deal.The UK transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has also declared that there would be no border checks at Dover when Britain leaves the EU in March, calling controls “utterly unrealistic”.However, the French believe this is not a sustainable position in the long term and are anticipating that checks could be needed eventually by Britain, but because of land limitations in Dover and Kent these may have to be done in Calais.“We are planning not just for day one but day 30, day 90,” said a spokesman for Bertrand.With the haulage industry dominated by eastern European companies, Bertrand also expressed concern that if Britain crashes out of the EU, there should be a plan to communicate to drivers who do not speak English or French.“To protect the SME/VSE sector and tourism and avoid congestion in the ports and tunnel, we must urgently conduct an information campaign [aimed at] logistics professionals from across Europe on new customs rules if there is no agreement,” he said in a tweet.Some British lorry drivers who frequently use the Calais-Dover route told the Guardian they were unconcerned about checks.“I do wine imports and all imports need documentation at the moment so that they can transit from France to a bonded warehouse in Britain,” said driver Dominic Salvatori.“I’m not overly worried because I think the tariff system would be very heavily based on sender/receiver honesty and coming down hard on lack of compliance,” he said.If there isn’t smuggling of dodgy or dangerous goods on a large scale now, why would there be post-Brexit, is the logic of Salvatori and one of his fellow drivers, Jon Slack.“Everything we carry has barcodes, is scanned and tracked,” said Slack, who takes medical equipment such as scalpels, scrapers and cutters from Sheffield to Aix-en-Provence.“The load on the way back may come from Spain or somewhere, but there is GPS on the lorries and a lot of companies are informed when their load goes on the lorry.

5950,"Having asked those of you living outside the UK if you were confused by the latest news from Brexitland, I got so many responses (thank you all) that I have grouped and paraphrased the most common ones so as to be able answer, at least approximately, as many as possible.And I’ve mostly stuck to factual questions on the Brexit process. “Will Brexit finally teach Britain it no longer rules the world?” from (among others) Steve Norman in Canada, Ferdy in Dublin and Thijs in the Netherlands, warrants a book-length response, but not now.Also, I’m not going into great detail explaining Brexit terminology: if you want answers to that I recommend the Guardian’s handy Brexit phrasebook which hopefully has most of it covered.What are the ground rules of Brexit? I’m seriously confused (Danni, US)Brexit is the process of the UK leaving the EU, which it narrowly voted in favour of in a referendum in June 2016. The process is governed by article 50 of the EU’s Treaty of Lisbon and is happening in two stages: first, the two sides negotiate their divorce deal (the “withdrawal agreement”), and after this they will sort out their future trading relationship. It’s proving problematic because the UK voted for a departure but not a destination: some think Britain should remain in a close relationship with the EU, with privileged access to its vast single market but having to obey its rules; others think its should strike out on its own, with greater control but less smooth trade. It’s complicated by the red lines set down by the prime minister, Theresa May, (ending the automatic right of EU citizens to settle in the UK, and leaving the EU’s single market and customs union) which exclude a lot of potential options.Can you explain the Irish backstop? (Diane Dalton, US, with related questions from Ton Pasman and Leonie, Netherlands; Shona, Ireland; Dietmar Homberg, Germany; Elisabeth Sanfuchs, Belgium; Ayaz Ramji, Canada)When the UK leaves the EU, the border between Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland, which is currently invisible, will become the EU’s only land border with the UK. Such a border normally requires customs and other controls. Nobody wants that, partly because nobody wants a return to the violence of the period before the Good Friday agreement, which removed border checks. In theory, the post-Brexit trading arrangements between the EU and the UK will avoid a “hard” border, but they could take years to negotiate so the EU has insisted on a “backstop” guaranteeing the absence of a hard border until those arrangements are in place. The backstop leaves the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU “unless and until” the EU agrees it can leave. Brexiters do not like this at all.Why is the deadline 29 March 2019 and what’s the problem with extending it? (Dawn, Canada; Jean Vigoureux, France)Article 50 provides for two years of talks; the UK triggered it on 29 March 2017 so in principle it leaves automatically two years later. It can ask the EU27 for an extension, which they have said they would grant for a valid reason, such as sorting out the final details of a deal that has the support of a majority in the UK parliament. This now looks quite likely, but it may only last for a few months because a new European parliament is sworn in in July and EU rules require all member states to be represented – a problem if the UK is still a member. Experts think this could be resolved with a temporary fix, but the EU would rather avoid the hassle.Can article 50 be revoked and how would the EU respond? (Benjamin Willumsen, Chile)The European court of justice has ruled that the UK can revoke article 50 unilaterally at any time without the permission of the EU27 (who would be delighted, if annoyed by all the UK has put them through). There’s disagreement in the UK about whether it could be done by a simple vote by MPs or would need an act of parliament, but in any case it looks like the last thing the government would do.Is there any chance of another referendum? (Michael Kerr, California; Johannes Meigen, Germany; David French, New Zealand; Laurent, France)There isn’t a majority in parliament for a “people’s vote”, or second referendum, which both the Tory and Labour leaderships argue would undermine people’s faith in democracy. That could change, but one of the problems is the time it could take to organise another vote: the government says it would take a year, which is an exaggeration, but it would almost certainly take longer than the UK has left, and possibly longer than the relatively short extension likely to be favoured by the EU.What is Labour’s position and why? Why does Jeremy Corbyn think he can negotiate a different or better deal with the EU than Theresa May? (Fernando Hervas, Belgium; Antje, Switzerland)Labour’s position is complicated by the fact that under the UK’s first-past-the-post electoral system, many of its MPs represent constituencies that voted to leave while most of its members and voters are pro-remain. Corbyn himself is also far from being a convinced pro-European. The party has sat on the fence until now – favouring a general election before all other options – but will soon have to come off it. If the EU agrees to rewrite parts of the withdrawal agreement, Labour could get a better deal than May if it dropped (some of) her red lines, but it has been as guilty as the Conservatives of pretending that Britain can leave the EU while retaining all the advantages of membership.Have any trade deals been approved with non-EU nations? What are World Trade Organization terms, and why are they a bad thing? (Patrick Speer, Scotland and Liam, Australia)Britain is not formally allowed to negotiate new trade deals while still an EU member. It has signed off on a text said to replicate current trading arrangements with Switzerland. Other than that, hardly any of the 68 trade deals from which the UK benefits as an EU member, and which it said it would have replicated by the time of departure, are near, and none will be ready by 29 March, according to the FT. Brexiters talk about “trading on WTO terms” as if it is what the world does, but it does not: it may trade under WTO rules, but all 164 members of the WTO have also agreed bilateral or regional trade deals that allow them to trade on much better terms than the WTO baselines. No sensible nation would leave the world’s largest single market, the EU, to trade with it on WTO terms, as would happen in the event of no deal.What might happen in the the first weeks and months after a no-deal Brexit? I’m travelling to Britain in April – will my trip be disrupted, might there be food shortages? (Mark Singer and Gerry Patey, Canada; Francois Bry, Munich; Jean Ballanco, US)As far as food shortages go, it’s anyone’s guess. Major British supermarket chains have started stockpiling tinned goods and MPs have said Britons may need to adopt a different diet, which does not sound promising, but it’s hard to imagine it coming to that. No deal would certainly be likely to cause disruption at airports; the European commission last month unveiled a temporary nine-month plan to keep planes in the air and goods and money flowing should the UK crash out, and Britain has the army standing by, but an awful lot of things we take for granted could change very suddenly if Britain leaves without a deal. British visitors to Europe will need to apply for an online visa waiver, similar to the the US Esta programme, once it comes into operation in 2020; if the UK crashes out before then, they may – depending on how the UK decides to treat EU visitors – require a Schengen area visa.Does the Queen have any powers to intervene? (Vincent, Netherlands; Isabel Pitta, Brazil)The monarch is not meant to get involved in politics. But she is the only person who can invite someone to form a government, and if Theresa May loses another no-confidence vote, she might have to. She would have 14 days to ask someone to form a new administration (including a cross-party option) providing it was clear they could command a majority in parliament. If no majority exists, new elections would automatically follow. The Queen, however, cannot dissolve parliament, having lost this power in the 2011 Fixed-term Parliament Act.Will my daughter, who is French, need to apply for a visa to study in the UK? Will we need international driver’s licences? (K Joubert, France; Michael Lea, Spain)European students currently studying in the UK or applying to start courses in 2019 will not face any additional restrictions because of Brexit, the government has said. It has warned, however, that UK drivers living in the EU should exchange their licence for a local one – and if possible get an international driving permit – as soon as possible in case of a no-deal Brexit, which might invalidate their UK licence, or mean they have to take a new driving test.How do you get out of this mess? When will all the turmoil be over – aren’t you going insane? (Remo Casale, New Zealand; Georg Beck, Germany)In order:By the British government softening its red lines to allow it to arrive at a form of Brexit that is acceptable to both the EU27 and the UK

6005,"When all solutions are bad, it’s time to reinvent the problem. Is it still possible to honour the initial Brexit referendum without crossing the EU’s red lines? Yes – through semi-Brexit.The UK is divided into four nations, two of which voted remain and two of which voted leave. The British government could honour those decisions and allow Scotland and Northern Ireland to remain in the EU as the successor state to the UK, while permitting England and Wales (if it still wants to) to exit.Semi-Brexit does not mean breaking up the UK. Rather the reverse: semi-Brexit may be the only way to hold the UK together. If the UK drags Scotland and Northern Ireland out of the EU, the chances of a UK breakup are much higher. But if Scotland and Northern Ireland remain, then England and Wales would have more flexibility to negotiate a better deal. Third states – that is, states outside the EU – cannot cherry-pick the bits of the EU that they want and reject those bits they don’t. But parts of EU member states that are otherwise outside the EU can.At least 35 countries and territories already have special deals with the EU that include, for example, free movement of goods into the EU without triggering the free movement of EU nationals back. Or deals that include something close to free trade without the jurisdiction of the European court of justice (ECJ). And on and on and on. The combinations of inside-EU privileges with extra-EU independence are very nearly endless. And they already exist.There’s just one catch: the territories that get to cherry-pick from the EU in these ways must remain constitutionally attached to a current EU member state. From “outermost regions” (nine of them) to “overseas territories” (25 of them) to bespoke agreements with the EU on the part of special regions (a half dozen or so), far-flung – and not so far-flung – territories have worked out special arrangements with the EU through their associated member state.One does not have to look far to see how. The Isle of Man has free trade with the EU for agricultural and manufactured products but is otherwise not bound by EU law. Guernsey has free trade in goods more generally, but no EU nationals have free movement rights into Guernsey. In fact, the array of models one could use for a bespoke deal for England and Wales is nearly endless. But getting these options requires part of the UK to stay in the EU.How would this be possible? The EU law questions are relatively easy while the heavy lifting, legally speaking, falls to UK constitutional law. The ECJ has just held that the UK can halt article 50 unilaterally. By doing that, the UK could put its negotiations with the EU on a different track.Of course, the EU wouldn’t tolerate an open-ended Brexit process wreaking havoc with long-term planning. The EU would have to know soon how to figure the UK into its parliamentary election cycle in 2019 and new budget cycle shortly after that. If, however, the UK were to announce that Scotland and Northern Ireland were staying in the EU while England and Wales exited, then the number of MEPs the new UK should elect in the new European parliament follows a formula. Ditto with the budget contribution. With these adjustments, the EU could go ahead and plan its future.Once the UK’s parameters in Europe were settled, the EU could begin negotiations with England and Wales over a new long-term relationship. The EU framework for special territories has no draconian deadlines – by contrast with the short deadlines of article 50.The harder transitional questions fall in UK constitutional law. The Westminster parliament would have to give the four nations the power to make international agreements in their own name so that each could remain a member of the EU (or not) separately. All subject areas covered by EU law would have to be devolved from Westminster to the four nations so that they could ensure harmonisation of their laws with EU law (or not).In the current UK constitution, however, the four nations are not equal: England would have to acquire its own parliament to receive the devolution. This idea has been well mooted already so plans are already available. In fact, the creation of an English parliament would bring self-government home even more dramatically than Brexiteers promised.Beyond that, there are questions about how to organise borders for whatever would not flow freely between the EU and the part of the UK that left. To control the flow of people, England and Wales could require residency and work permits for foreigners who live and work on its territory while the part of the UK that remained in the EU would allow free movement. UK corporations that wanted the benefits of EU status could reincorporate in Scotland while keeping their current offices in London – and charging a reasonable reincorporation tax would float Scotland’s budget again.In semi-Brexit, England and Wales might be able to negotiate free movement of exports under arrangements similar to those of the Channel Islands. If the EU were unwilling to go that far, however, arrangements for the movement of goods would, under this proposal, at least be displaced from the fraught international border between the UK and Ireland to the less-fraught borders between England and Wales and the rest of the UK. Without the pressing March deadline of article 50, these questions could be resolved in their own time. Perhaps Northern Ireland could even form a government by then.If England and Wales wanted one day to get back into the EU after semi-Brexit, re-entry would be easier than if the whole UK left. A single unanimous vote of the European council is sufficient for re-entry. In the process of re-entry, England and Wales would not lose all of their special agreements and opt-outs because the remaining UK would retain them.With semi-Brexit, the UK could honour the referendum and allow each part of the UK to get what it voted for. Semi-Brexit would also give the EU a graceful way to provide a better deal for England and Wales. Isn’t semi-Brexit, then, the least worst path forward?• Kim Lane Scheppele is the Laurance S Rockefeller professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University","A semi-Brexit, with

6038,"EU governments and businesses are ramping up their preparations to minimise the chaos and disruption of a no-deal Brexit, which many see as significantly more likely after the crushing defeat of Theresa May’s deal in parliament.With 72 days until the UK is due to leave the EU, France’s Medef business lobby told companies on Wednesday to prepare for a worst-case scenario, saying the vote “had made it quite possible that the UK will leave on 29 March without a deal”.The Dutch prime minister said that time was running out and urged the British to make up their minds. “A no-deal exit is of course worse than with a deal,” Mark Rutte said. “What the Netherlands is doing is trying to ensure that the damage is minimised.”Placing the blame firmly on London, Germany’s BDI business lobby said the vote meant that Britain was getting closer to a disorderly Brexit. With UK-German trade worth €175bn a year, the prospect of a no deal “endangers tens of thousands of companies and hundreds of thousands of jobs in Germany and especially in the UK”, it said. Germany’s carmakers, who sold 800,000 new cars in the UK last year, accounting for 20% of their global exports, were gloomy. “The consequences of a ‘no deal’ would be fatal,” their industry association, VDA, said after the vote, adding: “Jobs in the car industry, particularly on the British side, are on the line.”BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz urged British politicians to create clarity and ensure tariff-free trade can continue. “Uncertainty is not good for business ... We must therefore continue to prepare for the worst-case scenario, which is what a no-deal Brexit would represent,” BMW Group said.[The Belgian government has told businesses and citizens that a no-deal Brexit could lead to the imposition of up to €2.2bn (£1.96bn) in extra tariffs on goods and the loss of more than 40,000 jobs. It intends to present a package of emergency Brexit laws to parliament before the end of February.Belgium’s finance minister, Alexander de Croo, said it was time for the British to finally say what they wanted. “Over the last few months we’ve fallen from one surprise into another,” he said in an interview with De Ochtend. “The only constant is that the British are masters at shooting themselves in the foot and creating associated chaos.” De Croos said only 5,000 of the 25,000 Belgian companies that trade with Britain were ready for the customs checks that could follow Brexit and that the government would from this week “take a more pro-active approach”, allocating all those that were not already registered a customs number.The Spanish government this week launched an online information service for citizens and businesses, including advice on how to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. It has also drafted a decree enabling it to enact no-deal contingency provisions drawn up by the European commission.In a statement released shortly after Tuesday’s vote, the Spanish government said it regretted May’s defeat. It said a no-deal exit would have negative consequences for the EU but would be “catastrophic” for the UK.The EU’s executive last month unveiled a temporary nine-month plan – which the bloc can terminate unilaterally – to keep planes in the air and goods and money flowing should the UK crash out.The EU’s executive arm also urged governments to be generous in protecting basic rights for the 1.3 million Britons living in other member states by granting temporary residence permits while they resolved their long-term status.Several, including the Netherlands, Portugal, Poland and the Czech Republic, have done so, with others, including Austria and Sweden, announcing this week that they planned to rush through similar measures as part of omnibus laws.No-deal preparations are most advanced in member states that would be the most severely affected, such as Ireland, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. Dublin last month published its no-deal plans, conceding they were at best “a damage-limitation exercise”, and on Tuesday put forward a 17-part omnibus bill to speed through contingency laws on everything from health to tax and justice.Like most EU countries trading extensively with the UK, Ireland is hiring extra staff – 1,000 in its case – for customs controls, sanitary and phytosanitary checks and export certification. It is also acquiring land near Dublin and Rosslare ports for border inspection bays, truck parks and offices.Last month, Paris passed no-deal legislation that would keep people and freight moving between France and Britain and allow the government to pass emergency laws by decree if necessary to “stabilise” travel, residence, work and welfare issues for British citizens in France.French authorities are hiring an extra 700 customs officers, expanding border control infrastructure such as checkpoints, roads and lorry parks, and building warehouses in Calais, Cherbourg and near the entrance to the Channel tunnel.Germany is hiring an additional 900 customs officials to help ensure the smooth passage of goods, and has passed laws ensuring a limited number of euro financial products, including insurance, will be covered by the EU’s existing passporting regime in the event of no deal.The Netherlands, home to Europe’s largest port in Rotterdam, aims to have hired more than 900 extra customs officials by the end of the year – one-third of them by the time Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March – as well as 150 vets and other scientists for checks on food, plant and animal products.Along with the Belgians, French and Danish, the Dutch have launched comprehensive Brexit impact assessment schemes allowing companies to analyse their specific no-deal risks based on business sector and relationship with the UK.Sweden has identified a dozen or so sectors where the consequences of a no-deal Brexit could be “immediate and serious”, the country’s EU minister, Ann Linde, said last week.",EU states escalate no-deal preparations after May defeat,2019-01-16/10:48:11+0000,eu governments and businesses are ramping up their preparations to minimise the chaos and

6056,"The Irish government has said the country’s medicine supply will be threatened by a no-deal Brexit, with more than half of the 4,000 medicines marketed in Ireland coming from or transiting through the UK.While Westminster lurched towards a widely expected defeat of Theresa May’s Brexit deal, the Irish cabinet was making critical decisions to cope with the potential catastrophic effects of no deal.Ministers in Dublin heard that about 60-70% of medicines in Ireland came via the UK and the supply of some of these may be vulnerable if the UK crashes out of the EU.These included medicines with a short shelf life, special storage and transportation requirements and those with single supplier reliance, the government said in a statement after the cabinet meeting.The Department of Health said it did “not anticipate an immediate impact on medicine supplies” as there were additional supply stocks routinely built into the Irish supply chain. The government has also been planning a fast-tracking of essential drugs into Ireland to deal with “any delays and shortages”.The update gives a glimpse of the scale of the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Ireland, with some predicting the impact could be even greater than in the UK.The cabinet decided to push through a 17-part “omnibus” bill to “mitigate some of the most damaging effects of a no-deal Brexit”, covering trade, tax, health, jobs and policing and security.The deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said: “A no-deal Brexit will have a significant impact on Ireland. These measures being taken by the government are designed to limit the damage. It remains our view that the only way to secure an orderly withdrawal is to ratify the withdrawal agreement.”NEW: While Westminster debate continues Irish cabinet has today agreed to put forward one omnibus bill to speed no deal contingencies laws through.

6082,"The UK’s national daily newspapers have played a key role in shaping the debate on Brexit. This is what they have said in their editorial columns – and on Tuesday’s front pages – regarding Theresa May’s deal with Brussels on leaving the EU.The SunTomorrow's front page: Prince Harry reveals he meditates every day pic.twitter.com/VLFdbwr8tXThe Sun is highly critical of Theresa May’s deal but has so far stopped short of formally endorsing a no-deal exit from the EU.Instead, it has suggested that any attempt by remainers to pursue a softer Brexit would be seen as a betrayal of the EU referendum result, cause the government to collapse, and give control of Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn’s “anti-western Marxist rabble”.“If this remainer-stuffed government nullifies or destroys Brexit they can kiss goodbye to their jobs and their party,” the paper’s editorial said last week.On Tuesday, the paper kicks the can a little further down the road, choosing to focus on a suggestion the prime minister believes she could force a second vote if she loses. Notably, the story is not the most prominent on the Sun’s front.Daily MailTuesday’s Daily MAIL: “Time To Put Your Country First” #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/2IaSnnaEcOSince remain-supporting Geordie Greig took over the editorship from Paul Dacre in September, the Daily Mail has stuck closely to the Downing Street line on Brexit and backed May’s deal with Brussels as a solution to the “looming shambles” of a no-deal exit. The newspaper has repeatedly warned against attempts to overturn the result while insisting a Corbyn government is the real threat to Britain’s future.The front of Tuesday’s edition is dominated by a clarion call – not an uncommon occurrence for the paper when the stakes are high – for MPs to back the “imperfect” deal. It is time to focus on other matters, the paper says, denouncing the parlous state of some of the country’s public services and infrastructure.Greig’s former paper, the Mail on Sunday, has taken a pro-Brexit stance under its new editor, Ted Verity, albeit making it clear that “we cannot leave without a deal”.Daily TelegraphThe front page of tomorrow's Daily Telegraph 'Out of allies, out of time' #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/fsLVe4vultThe pro-Brexit newspaper owned by the Barclay brothers has been strongly critical of May’s deal, warning that any attempt to delay Britain’s exit from the EU would result in political radicalisation and a possible Corbyn government. On Tuesday, the paper is another to carry an editorial on its front, albeit only a short extract, in which it says it regrets having to oppose a Tory prime minister, but feels it has no choice. It would be a “historic mistake” to endorse this “dreadful deal”, the paper says.Its sister paper, the Sunday Telegraph, went further, describing it as an “appalling, misconceived” proposal: “Not only should MPs vote against the withdrawal agreement on Tuesday, but they must vote against it in large enough numbers to kill it dead, otherwise Theresa May will just keep bringing it back to the Commons until she gets her way.”The TimesTuesday’s TIMES: “May braced for historic defeat on Brexit D-Day” #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/KhtElh3OTcThe newspaper backed remain during the referendum but is now firmly behind May’s deal as a way of avoiding a chaotic exit at the end of March.“Her deal is not perfect but it would allow Britain to make an orderly withdrawal from the EU,” its editorial said on Monday, citing the commitment to guaranteeing citizens’ rights and meeting existing financial obligations. But its splash acknowledges May is expected to suffer a heavy defeat.The GuardianGuardian front page, Tuesday 15 January 2019: May facing crushing defeat in Brexit vote pic.twitter.com/1qBc7PAd34The Guardian has described the prime minister’s proposal as “a leap of faith, and scarcely more acceptable than no deal at all”, insisting it should be explicitly rejected, with the article 50 process paused and Brexit put on hold.Its editorial said last week: “MPs should then open up the debate to the country: first, by establishing a citizens’ assembly to examine the options and issues that face the nation; and second, by giving parliament the right, if it so chooses, to put these alternatives in a referendum this year or next.”Daily ExpressTuesday’s Daily EXPRESS: “Don’t Lose Our Trust For Ever” #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/fAB3UJueOyThe Daily Express is the staunchest backer of Brexit among the national papers but has also been a staunch backer of Theresa May’s deal with Brussels – being rewarded with interviews with the prime minister and additional briefings from Downing Street. The newspaper has said the current proposal is “far from perfect” but is the best offer on the table.“We want hard-nosed pragmatism to win the day,” the paper said, while urging the EU to make further concessions to help the deal pass the House of Commons.Daily MirrorTuesday’s Daily MIRROR: “Plan B” #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/uqDCzE7nAEThe Labour-supporting tabloid has trodden a careful line on Brexit, potentially because its readership is split down the middle on the question of leave and remain, according to YouGov polling commissioned by the People’s Vote campaign.It has endorsed the so-called Norway option of close alignment with the EU, believing it to be the least bad form of Brexit. Although the paper will not rule out a second referendum and would like a general election, it does not think the latter is likely in the near future.Financial TimesTuesday’s FINANCIAL TIMES: “Tory Eurosceptics threaten May with humiliation over Brexit deal” #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/B5TpyNudPOThe financial paper originally backed Theresa May’s deal, describing it as “imperfect but ultimately pragmatic” – a decision that earned the newspaper criticism from remain campaigners such as Andrew Adonis, who claim it is taking orders from its Japanese owners Nikkei.In France, Libération ran through the post-vote options, concluding with the possibility that “the Queen might run out of Buckingham Palace screaming: ‘Enough is enough.’” Alas, the paper added, this was unlikely.“The Queen does not have the right to intervene in political debate. Officially, she takes no view on Brexit at all. In that regard she is, of all the citizens of this deeply divided country, just about the only one.”The London correspondent of the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad reflected: “Brexit has not advanced a single step … Once, Brexiters promised a glorious future and were believed. Now, after two and a half years of argument, debate and defeats in Brussels, the shine has come off it.“Of course, there are Brits who are worried, angry and disappointed – but there are plenty more who cannot even bear to hear the the B-word. Brexit has become a terrible British family secret, that everyone wants to hush up.”Germany’s Die Zeit asked despairingly: “But where do you want to go?” before explaining: “The difficulty currently in the British parliament is that there is no obvious majority among MPs for any alternative” to May’s deal.El Pais in Spain warned that “unless there is a last-minute surprise, Theresa May is heading for a heavy defeat”. Part of the problem, it said, is that while May’s warnings of the potentially dire consequences of not voting for her deal “seem obvious to any well-informed analyst, to Brexiters they are simply more ‘project fear’.”","The papers on Brexit: betrayal, pragmatism or a leap of faith",2019-01-15/09:54:14+0000,the uk s national daily newspapers have played a key role in shaping the debate on brexit

6110,"British people living in the EU may have to take new driving tests after a no-deal Brexit if they do not exchange their UK licence for a European one before 29 March, the government has said.In advice issued on Monday focused on driving in the EU after Brexit, the Department for Transport (DfT) tells UK nationals: “In the event that there is no EU exit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in the EU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there.” It warns that as Brexit approaches, there may be delays in processing exchange applications.Short-term visitors could also have to return to the UK to obtain paperwork over a post office counter, with three different types of international driving permit potentially required for British holidaymakers in Europe in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Currently, British driving licence holders can drive in all EU and European Economic Area countries using their normal licence, without a permit.Ireland is the only EU country where British drivers will definitely still be able to travel without additional checks after Brexit, according to the government.Adding to the potential confusion and new rules for British drivers, visitors to France and Spain would also require different types of permits because the two countries ratified different conventions.Drivers with existing international driving permits (IDPs) issued in Britain, which are obtainable through motoring organisations such as the AA or RAC, have either 1949 or 1926 permits.Britain will start issuing a third type, for those countries that have ratified the 1968 convention on road traffic, which will be necessary for most EU member states – although a 1949 version will be needed for Spain, as well as Cyprus, Malta and Iceland.But from the end of January, the permits – which can currently be bought online for £5.50 – will only be obtainable at UK post-office counters.The AA described the situation as “a real mess”. Edmund King, the motoring organisation’s president, said: “Thousands of expats, many of them elderly, will not relish the prospect of having to retake their driving test in a different country and different language if there is no deal.“Drivers without the appropriate IDPs could also be turned back at the ports. Currently they could obtain an IDP from the AA shop at the Eurotunnel port, but that won’t be allowed after the end of this month.”“It’s another thing which is a real mess and could potentially catch people out, particularly expats. It really does seem a backward step that drivers will no longer be able to apply for IDPs in the post.”The UK will continue to allow EU citizens to drive with their EU licence in Britain after Brexit, the DfT confirmed, for up to three years after coming to live in the UK, and allow them to exchange their licence for a British one.The latest no-deal scenarios emerged as the government updated its information on travel after Brexit, including collating advice for those working in the aviation industry. UK licences or safety certificates for pilots and cabin crew may no longer be recognised in Europe after March, potentially grounding some who work for airlines operating in the EU – such as Ryanair.While the DfT advises pilots who could be affected to seek to transfer their licences to another European state, the regulator, the CAA, has said it cannot guarantee that process would take place in time.",Britons in EU may have to retake driving tests after a no-deal Brexit,2019-01-14/16:38:54+0000,british people living in the eu may have to take new driving tests after a no deal brexit if they do not exchange their uk licence for a european one before  march the government has said in advice issued on monday focused on driving in the eu after brexit the department for transport dft tells uk nationals in the event that there is no eu exit deal you may have to pass a driving test in the eu country you live in to be able to carry on driving there it warns that as brexit approaches there may be delays in processing exchange applications short term visitors could also have to return to the uk to obtain paperwork over a post office counter with three different types of international driving permit potentially required for british holidaymakers in europe in the event of a no deal brexit currently british driving licence holders can drive in all eu and european economic area countries using their normal licence without a permit ireland is the only eu country where british drivers will definitely still be able to travel without additional checks after brexit according to the government adding to the potential confusion and new rules for british drivers visitors to france and spain would also require different types of permits because the two countries ratified different conventions drivers with existing international driving permits idps issued in britain which are obtainable through motoring organisations such as the aa or rac have either  or  permits britain will start issuing a third type for those countries that have ratified the  convention on road traffic which will be necessary for most eu member states although a  version will be needed for spain as well as cyprus malta and iceland but from the end of january the permits which can currently be bought online for   will only be obtainable at uk post office counters the aa described the situation as a real mess edmund king the motoring organisation s president said thousands of expats many of them elderly will not relish the prospect of having to retake their driving test in a different country and different language if there is no deal drivers without the appropriate idps could also be turned back at the ports currently they could obtain an idp from the aa shop at the eurotunnel port but that won t be allowed after the end of this month it s another thing which is a real mess and could potentially catch people out particularly expats it really does seem a backward step that drivers will no longer be able to apply for idps in the post the uk will continue to allow eu citizens to drive with their eu licence in britain after brexit the dft confirmed for up to three years after coming to live in the uk and allow them to exchange their licence for a british one the latest no deal scenarios emerged as the government updated its information on travel after brexit including collating advice for those working in the aviation industry uk licences or safety certificates for pilots and cabin crew may no longer be recognised in europe after march potentially grounding some who work for airlines operating in the eu such as ryanair while the dft advises pilots who could be affected to seek to transfer their licences to another european state the regulator the caa has said it cannot guarantee that process would take place in time ,Brexit,0.15946564078330994
6143,"The archbishop of Canterbury has said a no-deal Brexit would hit the poorest and most vulnerable people in the UK.Justin Welby also said he was praying for Theresa May and other politicians at the start of what is expected to be one of the most tumultuous weeks in recent parliamentary history.Last week, Welby said in the House of Lords that a no-deal Brexit would be “not only a political and practical failure, but a moral one,” and a second referendum may be needed to avoid it.He repeated his concerns in an interview with Christian website Premier, saying: “The burden of proof is on those that are arguing for no deal, to show that it will not harm the poorest and most vulnerable … How we care about them and how our politics affects them is a deeply moral issue.”He added: “Politicians have one of the hardest jobs in the world. It is deeply difficult, and we need to pray for them. It is unbelievably difficult.“When I pray for Theresa May and for all of our politicians, which I do every day … [I pray for] wisdom, courage and strength for them and their families, and for them internally, their psychology, their sense of wellbeing … We entrust them with more responsibility than any of us could cope with.”Welby is known to have voted remain in the 2016 referendum, and has described the EU as “the greatest dream realised for human beings since the fall of the western Roman empire”.But since the referendum he has stressed the need for reconciliation. Supporters of remain and leave must exercise restraint in their language, he has urged. People and political leaders needed to “calm down the hatreds that have arisen over the last few years, [so] that we will move towards reconciliation,” he said last month.Previously he has indicated that he is opposed to a second referendum. But he told the House of Lords last week: “A second referendum is not my preference, but if parliament fails in the task entrusted to it, then regrettably it may be required. This is about more than Brexit, and parliament must not show itself unfit for the job.”A recent opinion poll found that 44% of Britons thought it was inappropriate for the archbishop to offer political opinions, compared with 35% who said it was appropriate.",Justin Welby: no-deal Brexit would harm poorest people in UK,2019-01-14/00:01:23+0000,the archbishop of canterbury has said a no deal brexit would hit the poorest and most vulnerable people in the uk justin welby also said he was praying for theresa may and other politicians at the start of what is expected to be one of the most tumultuous weeks in recent parliamentary history last week welby said in the house of lords that a no deal brexit would be not only a political and practical failure but a moral one and a second referendum may be needed to avoid it he repeated his concerns in an interview with christian website premier saying the burden of proof is on those that are arguing for no deal to show that it will not harm the poorest and most vulnerable how we care about them and how our politics affects them is a deeply moral issue he added politicians have one of the hardest jobs in the world it is deeply difficult and we need to pray for them it is unbelievably difficult when i pray for theresa may and for all of our politicians which i do every day i pray for wisdom courage and strength for them and their families and for them internally their psychology their sense of wellbeing we entrust them with more responsibility than any of us could cope with welby is known to have voted remain in the  referendum and has described the eu as the greatest dream realised for human beings since the fall of the western roman empire but since the referendum he has stressed the need for reconciliation supporters of remain and leave must exercise restraint in their language he has urged people and political leaders needed to calm down the hatreds that have arisen over the last few years so that we will move towards reconciliation he said last month previously he has indicated that he is opposed to a second referendum but he told the house of lords last week a second referendum is not my preference but if parliament fails in the task entrusted to it then regrettably it may be required this is about more than brexit and parliament must not show itself unfit for the job a recent opinion poll found that  of britons thought it was inappropriate for the archbishop to offer political opinions compared with  who said it was appropriate ,Brexit,0.16679705679416656
6145,"The EU is expected to publish a letter of clarification emphasising that any use of the Northern Ireland backstop designed to keep the land border open would only ever be temporary, although it will be a surprise if it makes much difference to the Commons arithmetic.Theresa May will also make a public appeal for support in a speech in Stoke-on-Trent in the morning, while MPs move on to day four of the Brexit debate, with Philip Hammond, the chancellor, closing proceedings. Monday night is the deadline for submitting amendments to the Brexit motion.If May allows it, MPs will finally get to vote on her Brexit deal, although few believe the prime minister can get it approved, given that more than 100 Tory MPs have said they will vote against it.John Bercow, the Speaker, will select which amendments to vote on. The one to watch is the Hilary Benn amendment, which rejects both May’s deal and no deal, and gives MPs a say in what happens next.The prime minister will conclude proceedings, speaking just before voting starts at 7pm. A result on the Benn amendment could come at about 7.30pm. If that falls, the all-important vote on May’s final deal is expected between 8 and 9pm. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, could immediately demand to hold a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, if she is defeated. A heavy loss, and May will face immediate calls to resign.If May were to prevail, business as usual would commence, starting with prime minister’s questions. But the DUP has threatened to abandon its confidence and supply agreement with the government if May’s deal goes through, leaving the Conservatives without an overall majority.A confidence vote could be held on Wednesday, if Corbyn calls for one. It will be hard for Labour to win, because in this scenario, if May’s deal is voted down, the DUP has said it will support the Conservatives in an attempt to get the Brexit deal renegotiated.If May suffers a heavy defeat – perhaps with 80 rebels or more – she may find she is not able to stay on. A more narrow defeat – 40 rebels or fewer – could encourage her to try to ask MPs to vote on the deal again, although it will almost certainly need to be revised first.May could make a dash to Brussels to see if there is any hope of renegotiating. If defeated, she has until the close of business on Monday 21 January to tell MPs what her plan B is; the Commons would then debate and vote on that later in the week.May could seek a general election, which Labour would support, but her own party may not. Soft Brexiters in the Conservative party could break ranks to see if there is majority support for the UK remaining in the customs union, and even the single market.Campaigners for a second referendum see this as their moment to strike: believing that their idea needs to be the last one standing – the only option that could achieve a majority in the house amid a crisis atmosphere.

6153,"The clock might be ticking to Brexit on 29 March, but even if Britain leaves the EU on that date, a “Cornish embassy” will continue to speak out in Brussels.Cornwall council is tendering for a contract for the continued operations of an office in the city “to support our efforts to define our place within the new UK/EU relationship”.About £240,000 has been put aside to support the project, which will cover what is envisaged to be a Brexit transition period.Providing that there is a deal between the UK and the EU, and therefore a transition period, the council states on the tender contract that EU funds will continue to flow until the end of 2023 into Cornwall and Isles of Scilly (CIoS).“Having a Cornwall Brussels office in place will ensure that we have a channel through which we can engage directly with EU stakeholders on funding issues during this period,” it says.A deadline of 11 February has been set for receipt of bids to the council, which is the only local authority in England covering what qualifies under EU rules as a less developed region (LDR).Cornwall had been receiving £80m a year in EU funding, according to the council, money that has gone into jobs, local businesses, infrastructure, training and research. It had been on course to receive about £350m for the next round of funding from the years after 2020.Despite this, Cornwall registered a leave vote of 56.5% during the EU referendum, a result that has mystified some but was explained in recent research by Exeter and Plymouth University as being due to perceptions of the EU as being remote.Liberal Democrat Adam Paynter, the leader of Cornwall council, said: “The EU has been very supportive for us both in terms of infrastructure and growing our economy and our Brussels office has been instrumental in keeping up with calls fro funding. We had a recent vote to keep the office.“Unfortunately the council did not do as it could have done in the past to ensure that people understood the benefits of EU membership and what the structural funds gave us.“That will be an issue for Cornwall – if we ever leave the EU. We have a little way to go but as a council we are working on being self-sufficient because we certainly don’t get the government support that may have been there in the past.”As well as supporting the continuation of the Brussels office, the council also voted to support holding a second referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU.",'Cornish embassy' would continue to represent county in EU,2019-01-13/17:15:39+0000,the clock might be ticking to brexit on  march but even if britain leaves the eu on that date a cornish embassy will continue to speak out in brussels cornwall council is tendering for a contract for the continued operations of an office in the city to support our efforts to define our place within the new uk eu relationship about   has been put aside to support the project which will cover what is envisaged to be a brexit transition period providing that there is a deal between the uk and the eu and therefore a transition period the council states on the tender contract that eu funds will continue to flow until the end of  into cornwall and isles of scilly cios having a cornwall brussels office in place will ensure that we have a channel through which we can engage directly with eu stakeholders on funding issues during this period it says a deadline of  february has been set for receipt of bids to the council which is the only local authority in england covering what qualifies under eu rules as a less developed region ldr cornwall had been receiving m a year in eu funding according to the council money that has gone into jobs local businesses infrastructure training and research it had been on course to receive about m for the next round of funding from the years after  despite this cornwall registered a leave vote of   during the eu referendum a result that has mystified some but was explained in recent research by exeter and plymouth university as being due to perceptions of the eu as being remote liberal democrat adam paynter the leader of cornwall council said the eu has been very supportive for us both in terms of infrastructure and growing our economy and our brussels office has been instrumental in keeping up with calls fro funding we had a recent vote to keep the office unfortunately the council did not do as it could have done in the past to ensure that people understood the benefits of eu membership and what the structural funds gave us that will be an issue for cornwall if we ever leave the eu we have a little way to go but as a council we are working on being self sufficient because we certainly don t get the government support that may have been there in the past as well as supporting the continuation of the brussels office the council also voted to support holding a second referendum on britain s membership of the eu ,Brexit,0.1771519035100937
6232,"Confused by the latest developments in the UK’s fraught departure from the European Union? Here’s your no-frills primer to what’s going on in Brexit – and what might happen next.Two-and-a-half years and a fraught series of negotiations after the UK voted to leave the EU, the two parties finally managed to sign their two-part divorce deal late last year.The first part of this is the 585-page withdrawal agreement covering the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British nationals on the continent, the sum Britain must pay the bloc for past commitments, and a mechanism (the “backstop”) to avoid customs and other border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The second part is a much shorter political declaration on the shape they would like their future trading relations to take, which is vaguely worded enough to allow for almost any outcome, from a close Norway-style relationship to a more distant free trade arrangement like the EU has signed with Canada.In theory, this whole package must now be approved by the British parliament so the necessary legislation can be passed to allow the UK to formally leave the EU as planned at the end of the two-year article 50 exit process on 29 March.Britain would then enter a 20-month transition period, during which nothing much will change and the future relationship will be negotiated, before finally stepping out into the big, wide world in December 2020 (or a bit later, depending on how long it takes to do the trade deal).Essentially because the withdrawal agreement – and particularly the backstop, which will come into force if the detailed terms of the future trading relationship do not manage to avoid that hard Irish border – does not have a majority in parliament.MPs in favour of Brexit fear it could leave Britain a perpetual Brussels “rule-taker”, potentially trapped in the EU’s regulatory orbit forever. Those opposed to Brexit say the deal risks leaving the country economically weakened, with no say in EU rule-making, and worse off all round than staying in the EU.The opposition Labour party rejects the deal, as do a large number of Conservative hardline Brexiters. The Democratic Unionist party, on which the government relies for its majority, also object, leaving the government facing a crushing defeat in the House of Commons.That is why Theresa May, the prime minister, pulled the Commons vote on the agreement that was planned pre-Christmas, rescheduling it for 15 January in the hope she could persuade the EU to come up with concessions or guarantees that would win her opponents (or enough of them) over.Good question. The EU hasn’t budged (it can’t, to any great extent: the agreement is legally binding, approved by 27 countries, and will not be reopened), and it is hard to see what supplementary assurances it could offer that would satisfy the Brexiters.Parliamentary resistance has not weakened, and the government has been reduced to trying to cut side-deals – in the form of amendments to the deal – with various different interest groups to try and peel off some of the objectors. Few observers think this tactic will work.In the meantime, the prime minister’s opponents in the Commons are waging a procedural guerilla war, tabling – and winning – amendments aimed at wresting more and more power over the process from the government and giving it to MPs instead, particularly if a no-deal Brexit looks likely.The problem is that while there is no clear majority for May’s deal, there is no clear majority for anything else either: not for a second referendum, nor a fresh election (Labour’s objective), or no deal (which almost all economist and business groups say would be a catastrophe), or a mooted “Norway-plus”, single-market style deal. And the clock is ticking.Assuming May is defeated on 15 January, many think it increasingly likely that the government may have to ask the EU27 for an extension to the two-year article 50 deadline to allow it – or more accurately, given the current mood, parliament – to look again at the existing deal, or try to develop an alternative Brexit approach it can agree on.Brexit, in other words, is far from over yet.",What is going on in Brexit – and what might happen next?,2019-01-11/01:00:16+0000,confused by the latest developments in the uk s fraught departure from the european union here s your no frills primer to what s going on in brexit and what might happen next two and a half years and a fraught series of negotiations after the uk voted to leave the eu the two parties finally managed to sign their two part divorce deal late last year the first part of this is the  page withdrawal agreement covering the rights of eu citizens in the uk and british nationals on the continent the sum britain must pay the bloc for past commitments and a mechanism the backstop to avoid customs and other border controls between northern ireland and the republic the second part is a much shorter political declaration on the shape they would like their future trading relations to take which is vaguely worded enough to allow for almost any outcome from a close norway style relationship to a more distant free trade arrangement like the eu has signed with canada in theory this whole package must now be approved by the british parliament so the necessary legislation can be passed to allow the uk to formally leave the eu as planned at the end of the two year article  exit process on  march britain would then enter a  month transition period during which nothing much will change and the future relationship will be negotiated before finally stepping out into the big wide world in december  or a bit later depending on how long it takes to do the trade deal essentially because the withdrawal agreement and particularly the backstop which will come into force if the detailed terms of the future trading relationship do not manage to avoid that hard irish border does not have a majority in parliament mps in favour of brexit fear it could leave britain a perpetual brussels rule taker potentially trapped in the eu s regulatory orbit forever those opposed to brexit say the deal risks leaving the country economically weakened with no say in eu rule making and worse off all round than staying in the eu the opposition labour party rejects the deal as do a large number of conservative hardline brexiters the democratic unionist party on which the government relies for its majority also object leaving the government facing a crushing defeat in the house of commons that is why theresa may the prime minister pulled the commons vote on the agreement that was planned pre christmas rescheduling it for  january in the hope she could persuade the eu to come up with concessions or guarantees that would win her opponents or enough of them over good question the eu hasn t budged it can t to any great extent the agreement is legally binding approved by  countries and will not be reopened and it is hard to see what supplementary assurances it could offer that would satisfy the brexiters parliamentary resistance has not weakened and the government has been reduced to trying to cut side deals in the form of amendments to the deal with various different interest groups to try and peel off some of the objectors few observers think this tactic will work in the meantime the prime minister s opponents in the commons are waging a procedural guerilla war tabling and winning amendments aimed at wresting more and more power over the process from the government and giving it to mps instead particularly if a no deal brexit looks likely the problem is that while there is no clear majority for may s deal there is no clear majority for anything else either not for a second referendum nor a fresh election labour s objective or no deal which almost all economist and business groups say would be a catastrophe or a mooted norway plus single market style deal and the clock is ticking assuming may is defeated on  january many think it increasingly likely that the government may have to ask the eu for an extension to the two year article  deadline to allow it or more accurately given the current mood parliament to look again at the existing deal or try to develop an alternative brexit approach it can agree on brexit in other words is far from over yet ,Brexit,0.3326781988143921
6328,"Japan’s prime minister, Shinzō Abe, who is to meet Theresa May in London on Thursday, will underscore the damage Brexit is likely to have on Japanese investment in Britain by first visiting the Netherlands, the country to which many UK-based Japanese firms are redeploying ahead of the UK’s departure from the EU.The choice of the Netherlands as the other stop on Abe’s mini-European tour is not a coincidence since he will also be given a chance to be briefed on how a no-deal Brexit could clog the flow of trade into Rotterdam, the main gateway for Japanese and British firms into the EU single market.Abe is also likely at a Downing Street press conference to urge acceptance of Theresa May’s Brexit deal, but he will be watched to see how closely he echoes the words of the UK business secretary, Greg Clark, that a no-deal Brexit cannot be contemplated.British officials insist the visit to London is not a panicked effort to dragoon influential overseas support for her deal, but instead forms part of a pattern of visits designed to strengthen relations with Japan across the fields of business, security and research.But some Japanese firms have lost patience with the UK’s inability to provide Brexit certainty and are setting up parallel offices, primarily in the Netherlands, to ensure they have a bolthole in the event of a no-deal Brexit, or a deal that severely restricts UK-based firms’ access to the EU single market.Companies that have transferred headquarters to Holland include Panasonic, and the banks Nomura and Daiwa.The UK absorbs 40% of Japanese investment destined for the EU.Jeroen CM Nijland, the commissioner of the Netherlands foreign investment agency, said the body was handling about 250 Brexit-related projects.

6349,"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, back after a seasonal break – and essential reading now more than ever. If you would like to receive it as a weekly email, please sign up here. And catch our monthly Brexit Means … podcast here.Producing the Guardian’s independent, in-depth journalism takes time and money. We do it because we believe our perspective matters, and it may be yours, too. If you value our Brexit coverage, please become a Guardian supporter. Thank you.Here we are, then: 2019. In less than three months, the UK is due to leave the EU. Not that you’d know it. The withdrawal deal struck between Theresa May and the EU27 is no closer to winning MPs’ approval than it was before Christmas.After the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, told the UK to “get its act together”, the prime minister urged the Commons in her new year address to allow the the country to “turn a corner” by voting through the unpopular deal.But she failed to win any concessions from EU leaders over the Christmas period and, having insisted MPs will vote on the agreement in the week starting 14 January (the UK will be “in uncharted territory” if they reject it, she warned), has now launched a fresh round of appeals to the bloc to cut her some slack on the Irish backstop.“Friendly” conversations with, among others, Juncker have so far got her nowhere, with the EU adamant that negotiations on the withdrawal agreement “have been concluded” and the bloc has gone as far as it can in offering reassurances over the backstop.Germany and Ireland are doing what they can, but any potential fix they come up with will be limited to tweaks to the political declaration. The EU could perhaps offer an “exchange of letters” confirming its intention to conclude trade talks by 2021, so avoiding the need for the backstop, but whether that will satisfy Tory Brexiters or the DUP, which has ruled out backing the deal, is far from clear.Labour, meanwhile, will support a backbench amendment that could severely restrict the government’s taxation powers unless no deal is taken off the table, and could offer a second referendum on an EU deal it renegotiates, as the party leadership came under intense pressure over its Brexit policy.One poll showed Labour support would collapse at the next election if it eventually backed a Brexit deal, while another survey of party members suggested most believed Jeremy Corbyn should back a second Brexit vote – 90% would opt to remain. So far, however, the Labour leader has remained defiant.Meanwhile, Brexit-related economic gloom deepened. Economists predicted GDP growth of just 0.1% for the final quarter of 2018, manufacturers face their biggest worker shortage in 30 years and house prices took a major hit.Police reinforcements are to be deployed to Northern Ireland to deal with the disorder of a possible no-deal Brexit, which universities said would be catastrophic, and the government has signed a £14m contract with a ferry firm that has no ferries and copied its T&Cs from a fast food delivery joint.As the prime minister announced she would chair a new cabinet committee on Brexit planning, including for no deal, the one thing we can be sure of is that it’s going to be a fun-packed few weeks.Parliament will finally have its delayed vote on the withdrawal agreement on 15 January, government sources have confirmed. Before then, May aims to offer reassurances in three areas: Northern Ireland, the role of parliament in future negotiations and (in written and legal form) the role of EU27 member states.The DUP and hardliner Tory Brexiters will not be convinced, and the EU is unlikely to make any further concessions until MPs have defeated the agreement at least once, as seems almost certain, so as to prevent Brexiters from coming back for yet more.If the margin of the defeat is less than about 100, the government may make a final appeal to the EU27 for help in the unlikely hope it can come back to parliament with a substantively different proposition.Pressure on May will increase. Labour could table a vote of no confidence, and hard-Brexiters in her cabinet could revolt. Ultimately, she hopes to convince the DUP, Tory hardliners and enough Labour leavers in a second parliamentary vote that the choice is her Brexit, no deal, or no Brexit at all.A very heavy defeat on 15 January, or a second defeat, could trigger a crisis. Anything could happen: a mass cabinet walkout; indicative votes; a change of strategy, perhaps towards a permanent customs union; a second referendum, or an election (though the two latter options would mean extending article 50, requiring EU27 agreement).No-deal Brexit lorry rehearsal in Kent “a waste of time”.May will win vote on her deal on 15 January, says Brexit minister.Most Tory members would choose no deal over May’s plan.Chris Patten says UK must have second EU referendum.John Redwood says UK is losing sight of Brexit benefits.No-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for UK farmers, warns the NFU.UK nationals in Italy assured of residency in event of no-deal Brexit.Publicity drive to prepare UK public for possible no-deal Brexit.Sadiq Khan angers Brexiters with pro-EU fireworks display.Record number of Britons seek Irish passports before Brexit.In the Guardian, Anne Perkins says of Channel 4’s Brexit drama The Uncivil War, which focuses on the role of Dominic Cummings, that Brexit was “fuelled by deceit, not one oddball”:The shameless misinformation that Cummings and his associates propagated was infinitely more brazen and dangerous than anything that has gone before … Their audacity was best summed up in the single, Cummings-crafted message, “Take back control”, implying that control – sovereignty – had been frivolously, cravenly surrendered by an effete political class for no discernible reward. The notorious pledge of £350m a week to the NHS was the symbol of what restored sovereignty would deliver. It was a grossly misleading figure that crowned a campaign based on deceit. No one imagines we live in a world where politicians never dissemble, but nor did we imagine that they painted deliberate untruths on campaign buses.Simon Jenkins says MPs should be given a free vote on the deal:There is said to be a majority of MPs against no deal, but that means nothing without a positive alternative. There is none. There is only May’s deal. The Brexiters’ argument that Britain held all the cards was rubbish. Next week’s vote still looks hopeless, but that is because so many MPs will defy their whips. This is a classic case where parliament should rise above party. May should agree with Corbyn to have next week’s vote a free one, and to let conscience divide the house. Parliament is the national interest in conclave. MPs at this time should decide individually, not tribally.Labour’s David Lammy on that no-deal Brexit rehearsal (in the end, only 89 trucks showed up):There is no better representation of the sheer absurdity of Brexit than this. 150 lorries driving round a disused airport practising the popular British pastime of queuing, in preparation for an entirely self-inflicted national catastrophe.

6398,"Labour could offer to hold a referendum on an EU deal that it had renegotiated as part of an early general election manifesto, a shadow cabinet minister has suggested.Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, said Labour could campaign on a promise to negotiate a better Brexit deal than that secured by Theresa May, and said he personally believed that any such deal could then be put to the public.Labour’s official policy is to push for a general election if the prime minister fails to get her Brexit deal through parliament, but that all other options remain on the table.Jeremy Corbyn is facing demands from MPs – including several shadow cabinet members – to throw his weight behind a referendum if Labour cannot force an early election.Pressure has intensified after a major opinion poll commissioned by the People’s Vote campaign indicated Labour could suffer a backlash from voters if it failed to oppose Brexit in parliament. The YouGov poll of more than 25,000 people indicated a second referendum is backed by 75% of Labour voters.Gardiner, interviewed on Sky News, said the quickest way of getting a people’s vote was to have a general election, because legislating for a referendum would take far longer.At an election, Labour “would set out what we would seek to negotiate in Europe to try and deliver,”, he told presenter Sophy Ridge.Gardiner said May had botched her EU negotiations because of her red lines. “If we as a new, incoming Labour government were to go to Europe without those red lines we know that we could get a different, better deal.“At that stage it makes sense to go to the country and say, ‘here we are, this is what we have managed to negotiate, this is the deal that we have managed to conclude because we don’t have the same red lines as Theresa May.’“And it seems to me, at a personal level, what I would then say is that is the time when we would then say to people, ‘now make your decision on what we have managed to conclude,’” he said.Gardiner’s comments come after the YouGov poll found Labour trail the Tories at 34% to 40% as it stands, with Labour’s support falling to 26% if Labour MPs voted with the Tories to bring about Brexit.A Labour source said the party had made clear its priority was a good deal or a general election but without these, “all options” remained on the table, including a campaign for a public vote.In further signs of tensions over the People’s Vote campaign, Emily Thornberry accused it of seeking to “slap the Labour party around”.The shadow foreign secretary told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Pienaar’s Politics: “What I would like them to be particularly focusing on is taking the arguments as to why we should remain in the European Union to people who voted to leave and to try to change some hearts and minds, rather than using it – as some people I think do – as an opportunity to attack the Labour party and the leadership of the Labour party.”A People’s Vote spokesman said Thornberry was “badly mistaken” in her views about the campaign, adding: “What we are doing is highlighting the biggest poll on Brexit yet, which shows that Labour will suffer its worst electoral defeat since the 1930s if it continues promising to enable some sort of Brexit to go ahead.“In that situation, it won’t be us slapping the leadership but millions of Labour voters who want the party to fight for the public services, rights and living standards that will otherwise be hammered by any kind of Brexit deal.”","Labour could offer second EU referendum, says

6517,"Boris Johnson will still need a bloc of Labour MPs to vote for any Brexit agreement struck with the EU, even if his whips have managed to reduce the number of Tory Eurosceptic “Spartans” holding out against a deal down to just eight.The prime minister insisted again on Monday that he wants a deal with Brussels that removes the Northern Ireland backstop. But even if he secures some concessions that he can sell as a new deal, his chances of getting that agreement through the House of Commons remain extremely finely balanced.On the current numbers, he has 287 MPs who voted for a deal last time, while there are 289 MPs from opposition parties and independents who are against a deal.Johnson would need to reach a total of 319 MPs to win a vote, discounting Sinn Féin MPs, the speaker and his deputies, who all do not vote, and three Labour MPs who abstained last time round.Analysis by the Guardian shows there are about 60 MPs who potentially could go either way. These include 28 Spartans who refused to vote for Theresa May’s deal but could potentially be persuaded to back a Johnson-led agreement, plus 10 DUP MPs who Johnson is trying to sign up to his new plan for a watered-down version of a Northern Ireland-only backstop.Tory sources have told the Sun that the Conservative whips believe that the 28 rebels can be squeezed down to about eight of the hardest Eurosceptics. But even in the best case scenario for the prime minister of an extra 20 Tories and 10 DUP MPs on board, Johnson would still need some Labour votes to very narrowly squeeze a deal through the Commons.There are 26 Labour MPs who have signed a letter publicly urging Jeremy Corbyn to try to strike a Brexit deal before 31 October, of whom five have already previously voted for a deal and one abstained. Of the remaining bloc of 21, many of them would want to see at the very least concessions offered by May during talks with Labour enshrined in the agreement before voting for it, but several have indicated to the Guardian they are getting to the point where they are likely to vote for almost any agreement to end the impasse and avoid a second referendum or no-deal situation.The closeness of the numbers would be likely to put huge pressure on individual MPs and lead to some big personal decisions. Jo Johnson, the prime minister’s brother who resigned from his top team over Brexit, previously voted against May’s deal because of his support for a second referendum, but could potentially switch sides this time.The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU’s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.Daniel BoffeySir Norman Lamb, a Liberal Democrat MP, is also now on the record expressing support for some sort of deal, which goes against his party’s new policy of being in favour of revoking article 50.A source close to one pro-deal cabinet minister said Johnson had not yet started wooing Labour MPs but that would come at the last minute if it appears more likely that an agreement palatable to the DUP is taking shape.The source said most of the Spartan Tories have, politically, “nowhere else to go” now that the prime minister is mandated by law to request an extension on 31 October if no deal is passed.A cross-party group of MPs last week formally launched a campaign to win support in the Commons for Brexit via a managed deal, arguing both a no-deal departure or a second referendum would cement political divisions and cause endless uncertainty.The organisers – including the Labour MPs Caroline Flint and Stephen Kinnock as well as Lamb and the former Tory Rory Stewart – claim up to 50 MPs so far may back the plan, which would involve using elements of May’s Brexit proposals as the basis for an agreement which Boris Johnson could steer through parliament, possibly in time for a 31 October departure.",Johnson dependent on Labour MP votes for any Brexit deal,2019-09-16/19:55:38,boris johnson

6707,"Boris Johnson has been publicly offered a non-aggression pact by Nigel Farage if he signs up fully to a no-deal departure from the EU and the Conservatives stand aside in more than 80 seats, amid signs the prime minister could be considering softer options for a deal with Brussels.The Brexit party leader urged the prime minister to strike an agreement to stand jointly in favour of no deal, at a time of increasing speculation that Johnson is revisiting ways of making a version of Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement work.Johnson insists he is not proposing a Northern Ireland-only backstop, which EU leaders hope he could move towards, as that would not be acceptable to the Democratic Unionist party. However, the idea of an all-Ireland agrifood zone of regulatory alignment as part of the solution was discussed on Tuesday by Johnson and Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, as long as it did not extend to an all-Ireland customs area with a tariff border in the Irish Sea.The idea would not be enough to satisfy Brussels that the backstop is no longer necessary, but the discussions were taken as a sign that Johnson is more focused than ever on finding solutions to the Irish border problem.A No 10 spokesman said Johnson rejected the idea of an alliance with Farage, saying he “has been clear – no pact”.It comes as the Sun reported that Johnson recently claimed to anti-no-deal Tory rebels that ultimately the hardline Eurosceptic Conservatives would be the ones putting “spears in my back” when they realise he is prepared to make a compromise on a deal.The prime minister also told cabinet he was fundamentally liberal and should be regarded as a “Brexity Hezza”– a reference to the former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine.Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, did not deny Johnson was looking at softer options for a deal on Wednesday morning, as she appeared on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We are looking at creative ways to ensure no Irish backstop,” she said. “We are looking at getting a good deal that works for the UK that is different to existing one.”However, Farage is preparing to exploit any move by Johnson towards a return to May’s withdrawal deal, which the prime minister had promised his supporters was dead and that the backstop must be completely removed.The Brexit party took out a full-page advert in the Sun and a wraparound ad in the Daily Express, setting out its terms for a hard Brexit alliance to take on tactical voting among supporters of the pro-referendum parties.Farage would pledge to give the Tories a clear run at all their existing seats and targets if the Brexit party were to get a similar deal in 80-90 constituencies. Johnson would also have to sign up unequivocally to a no-deal departure.He challenged Johnson: “If you have the courage for a clean-break Brexit, then we will help you secure a big Brexit majority. Together we can destroy Corbyn’s Labour”.Farage’s high-profile adverts appear designed to publicise his harder Brexit position than Johnson in the months before a possible election, with little chance that the prime minister could accept such a high price for a pact.However, most recent polling suggests the Conservatives would be short of a majority with Farage’s Brexit party eating into his vote and the possibility of pro-referendum parties – Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and others – potentially able to cobble together a majority for a remain alliance.",Nigel Farage offers Boris Johnson no-deal Brexit election pact,2019-09-11/09:31:51,boris johnson has been publicly offered a non aggression pact by nigel farage if he signs up fully to a no deal departure from the eu and the conservatives stand aside in more than  seats amid signs the prime minister could be considering softer options for a deal with brussels the brexit party leader urged the prime minister to strike an agreement to stand jointly in favour of no deal at a time of increasing speculation that johnson is revisiting ways of making a version of theresa may s withdrawal agreement work johnson insists he is not proposing a northern ireland only backstop which eu leaders hope he could move towards as that would not be acceptable to the democratic unionist party however the idea of an all ireland agrifood zone of regulatory alignment as part of the solution was discussed on tuesday by johnson and arlene foster the dup leader as long as it did not extend to an all ireland customs area with a tariff border in the irish sea the idea would not be enough to satisfy brussels that the backstop is no longer necessary but the discussions were taken as a sign that johnson is more focused than ever on finding solutions to the irish border problem a no  spokesman said johnson rejected the idea of an alliance with farage saying he has been clear no pact it comes as the sun reported that johnson recently claimed to anti no deal tory rebels that ultimately the hardline eurosceptic conservatives would be the ones putting spears in my back when they realise he is prepared to make a compromise on a deal the prime minister also told cabinet he was fundamentally liberal and should be regarded as a brexity hezza a reference to the former deputy prime minister michael heseltine andrea leadsom the business secretary did not deny johnson was looking at softer options for a deal on wednesday morning as she appeared on bbc radio  s today programme we are looking at creative ways to ensure no irish backstop she said we are looking at getting a good deal that works for the uk that is different to existing one however farage is preparing to exploit any move by johnson towards a return to may s withdrawal deal which the prime minister had promised his supporters was dead and that the backstop must be completely removed the brexit party took out a full page advert in the sun and a wraparound ad in the daily express setting out its terms for a hard brexit alliance to take on tactical voting among supporters of the pro referendum parties farage would pledge to give the tories a clear run at all their existing seats and targets if the brexit party were to get a similar deal in   constituencies johnson would also have to sign up unequivocally to a no deal departure he challenged johnson if you have the courage for a clean break brexit then we will help you secure a big brexit majority together we can destroy corbyn s labour farage s high profile adverts appear designed to publicise his harder brexit position than johnson in the months before a possible election with little chance that the prime minister could accept such a high price for a pact however most recent polling suggests the conservatives would be short of a majority with farage s brexit party eating into his vote and the possibility of pro referendum parties labour the liberal democrats the snp and others potentially able to cobble together a majority for a remain alliance ,Brexit,0.31418633460998535
6740,"A close ally of the Irish prime minister is poised to get a key role in post-Brexit negotiations in Brussels as the new commissioner for trade.Phil Hogan, the agriculture commissioner, is expected to be formally appointed to the role of EU trade commissioner on Tuesday by the incoming commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and will take up his role on 1 November.In his new job Hogan will represent the EU at the World Trade Organization and oversee talks in a move that could sound alarm bells for Brexiters hoping for a swift trade deal.But his appointment could also be a blessing for Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, who told Boris Johnson that Ireland would be the UK’s closest friend and ally in trade negotiations.Hogan, 59, is from the same party as Varadkar, Fine Gael, and was appointed after being nominated by the taoiseach’s predecessor, Enda Kenny.Announcing Hogan’s appointment, Von der Leyen said: “He will be a very fair, but determined negotiator.”Von der Leyen also reiterated that the manner of Britain’s EU departure would shape its future relationship with the bloc. “Brexit, should it happen, is not the end of something, but it is the beginning of our future relationship.”Von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, has previously told the Guardian that she was “open to listening” to a request for extension “if there are good reasons”.Known in Ireland as “Big Phil”, Hogan is a fixer, bruiser and wily operator. The Irish Times recently described him as “a sometimes abrasive political figure at home” but “also a deft political strategist” who had recently come under attack from farmers in Ireland over a proposed beef deal with countries in the South American Mercosur bloc.He has been highly critical of the British approach to Brexit and recently he launched a scathing attack on Johnson, describing him as an unelected prime minister who was “gambling” with Ireland’s peace process.He also warned that a hard Brexit would create a “foul atmosphere” with the EU and would have “serious consequences” for the UK’s chances of a favourable trade deal with the bloc.However, others in Ireland see his appointment to the trade portfolio as a positive step for Johnson because the taoiseach and his deputy have repeatedly promised over the past three years that they would be the UK’s strongest ally in trade talks, because no country wants a better outcome than its westerly neighbour.On Monday, Varadkar warned Johnson that trade talks with the EU would be a “herculean” challenge but said Ireland would act as his friend in Brussels. “We want to be your friend and ally, your Athena,” he said in reference to the Greek goddess who prevented Hercules from murdering his foster parent.Von der Leyen’s commission will be the first not to include a British member since 1973. The remaining 27 EU member states have nominated a politician to send to Brussels. Only the UK did not propose a candidate, in line with Johnson’s determination to leave on 31 October “do or die”.But Von der Leyen said the UK would have to appoint a commissioner if it was still in the EU after 1 November.European commissioners swear an oath not to take instructions from any government and act in the general interest of the bloc. The UK’s current commissioner, the career diplomat Sir Julian King, was given a job to promote the EU’s “security union”, after Lord Hill quit his post on financial services days after the 2016 referendum result.",Irish PM's ally to get key post-Brexit role as EU trade commissioner,2019-09-10/16:09:20,a close ally of the irish prime minister is poised to get a key role in post brexit negotiations in brussels as the new commissioner for trade phil hogan the agriculture commissioner is expected to be formally appointed to the role of eu trade commissioner on tuesday by the incoming commission president ursula von der leyen and will take up his role on  november in his new job hogan will represent the eu at the world trade organization and oversee talks in a move that could sound alarm bells for brexiters hoping for a swift trade deal but his appointment could also be a blessing for leo varadkar the taoiseach who told boris johnson that ireland would be the uk s closest friend and ally in trade negotiations hogan  is from the same party as varadkar fine gael and was appointed after being nominated by the taoiseach s predecessor enda kenny announcing hogan s appointment von der leyen said he will be a very fair but determined negotiator von der leyen also reiterated that the manner of britain s eu departure would shape its future relationship with the bloc brexit should it happen is not the end of something but it is the beginning of our future relationship von der leyen a former german defence minister has previously told the guardian that she was open to listening to a request for extension if there are good reasons known in ireland as big phil hogan is a fixer bruiser and wily operator the irish times recently described him as a sometimes abrasive political figure at home but also a deft political strategist who had recently come under attack from farmers in ireland over a proposed beef deal with countries in the south american mercosur bloc he has been highly critical of the british approach to brexit and recently he launched a scathing attack on johnson describing him as an unelected prime minister who was gambling with ireland s peace process he also warned that a hard brexit would create a foul atmosphere with the eu and would have serious consequences for the uk s chances of a favourable trade deal with the bloc however others in ireland see his appointment to the trade portfolio as a positive step for johnson because the taoiseach and his deputy have repeatedly promised over the past three years that they would be the uk s strongest ally in trade talks because no country wants a better outcome than its westerly neighbour on monday varadkar warned johnson that trade talks with the eu would be a herculean challenge but said ireland would act as his friend in brussels we want to be your friend and ally your athena he said in reference to the greek goddess who prevented hercules from murdering his foster parent von der leyen s commission will be the first not to include a british member since  the remaining  eu member states have nominated a politician to send to brussels only the uk did not propose a candidate in line with johnson s determination to leave on  october do or die but von der leyen said the uk would have to appoint a commissioner if it was still in the eu after  november european commissioners swear an oath not to take instructions from any government and act in the general interest of the bloc the uk s current commissioner the career diplomat sir julian king was given a job to promote the eu s security union after lord hill quit his post on financial services days after the  referendum result ,Brexit,0.22381964325904846
6754,"After three years of debate and negotiation there is little new under the sun when it comes to Brexit. But it is rumoured in Westminster, and hoped in Brussels, that Boris Johnson is to revert to a Northern Ireland-only backstop as he seeks to move past the Brexit impasse and avoid breaking his word and extending the UK’s membership beyond 31 October.The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between the end of the stand-still transition period that is offered in the withdrawal agreement and the start of an all-solving future economic relationship.The backstop in the current withdrawal agreement would temporarily keep Northern Ireland in the single market, meaning some checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain. But the whole of the UK would stay in a shared customs territory with the EU. This insurance arrangement was negotiated by Theresa May because the then prime minister was of the opinion that no British prime minister could countenance agreeing to the EU’s first proposal: a backstop that involved only Northern Ireland staying in the EU’s customs territory. That would involve a customs border being drawn in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK.Boris Johnson has been thwarted from holding a general election or taking the country out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. But the prime minister has also said  he would rather “die in a ditch” than ask the EU for an extension to the UK’s membership. Logic would suggest his only option now would be to agree a tweaked deal with the EU and bring it back to parliament in October. He has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agrifood zone, which is one part of a Northern Ireland-only backstop. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements. Johnson’s EU envoy, David Frost, has already sought to discuss governance with the EU of any NI-only arrangements.Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable.It is difficult to see where Johnson finds a majority in parliament. Labour, the Democratic Unionists and a large number of Conservative backbenchers have opposed the NI-only backstop in the past. An NI-only arrangement does, however, allow the UK to pursue its own trade policy, unlike the backstop in the withdrawal agreement. It could be the landing zone after a general election for a newly returned Johnson administration if the parliamentary arithmetic has changed.",A Northern Ireland-only backstop: what is it and will anyone go for it?,2019-09-10/11:39:36,after three years of debate and negotiation there is little new under the sun when it comes to brexit but it is rumoured in westminster and hoped in brussels that boris johnson is to revert to a northern ireland only backstop as he seeks to move past the brexit impasse and avoid breaking his word and extending the uk s membership beyond  october the british government s version of brexit involves the uk leaving the single market and customs union requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland the backstop is intended as a placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between the end of the stand still transition period that is offered in the withdrawal agreement and the start of an all solving future economic relationship the backstop in the current withdrawal agreement would temporarily keep northern ireland in the single market meaning some checks on goods entering northern ireland from britain but the whole of the uk would stay in a shared customs territory with the eu this insurance arrangement was negotiated by theresa may because the then prime minister was of the opinion that no british prime minister could countenance agreeing to the eu s first proposal a backstop that involved only northern ireland staying in the eu s customs territory that would involve a customs border being drawn in the irish sea may described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the uk boris johnson has been thwarted from holding a general election or taking the country out of the eu without a deal on  october but the prime minister has also said he would rather die in a ditch than ask the eu for an extension to the uk s membership logic would suggest his only option now would be to agree a tweaked deal with the eu and bring it back to parliament in october he has opened the current talks by proposing an all ireland agrifood zone which is one part of a northern ireland only backstop the suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further ni only arrangements johnson s eu envoy david frost has already sought to discuss governance with the eu of any ni only arrangements given an ni only backstop was an eu proposal in the first place the u turn would be warmly welcomed although attempts to give the northern ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable it is difficult to see where johnson finds a majority in parliament labour the democratic unionists and a large number of conservative backbenchers have opposed the ni only backstop in the past an ni only arrangement does however allow the uk to pursue its own trade policy unlike the backstop in the withdrawal agreement it could be the landing zone after a general election for a newly returned johnson administration if the parliamentary arithmetic has changed ,Brexit,0.4086313843727112
6795,"The attention of Brexit-watchers has understandably been focused on Boris Johnson’s disastrous week in parliament and the exact timing of any election. But key to what happens next is, of course, the EU’s position.When UK (and European) commentators talk about the EU’s stance on Brexit, they almost invariably conclude that “nothing has changed”. Europe’s unity is paramount. Ireland will not be sacrificed. The withdrawal agreement will not be reopened. Even suggesting that Germany’s deteriorating economic conditions may give Berlin some pause for thought is tantamount to heresy. The EU’s Brexit position is fixed in time and space. The truth, as always, is more nuanced, as I learned during meetings in Brussels at the end of last week. There is real debate in the EU about Brexit. The EU’s position today is subtly different to that of two weeks ago. And its position of two weeks ago subtly different to that which came before. So where is the EU currently on Brexit?The EU liked Olly Robbins, Theresa May’s Brexit negotiator. Intelligent, thoughtful, persistent and tirelessly hardworking, he was widely respected among his EU peers as someone they could do business with. They were less keen on May herself. Their misgivings were well-founded. Robbins negotiated a Brexit deal widely recognised in Europe as an excellent outcome for the UK, in light of the red lines his prime minister had drawn at the time. Yet May proved incapable of managing the domestic politics and selling his deal. This provides the context for understanding how the EU sees Johnson.While there is a lot in him they dislike, they welcomed the fact he is a “red-blooded politician”, as one adviser to an EU head of state put it to me. A breath of fresh air compared to May. The fact Brexit is inherently political for Johnson – a means to a bigger Commons majority – creates the glimmer, no matter how slight, that he may be able to get a deal over the line. This, combined with Johnson’s singular focus on the backstop, and his willingness to adopt “a continental line” on global issues at the G7 in Biarritz, gave EU leaders more confidence a deal could possibly be struck.This was partly why the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, signalled a willingness to explore changes to the backstop, insofar as any new UK proposals protect the Irish peace process and the EU’s single market.This view still holds – just – despite the events of the last few weeks. But it’s equally fair to say that the goodwill Johnson did establish is quickly ebbing. But this is not for the reasons people might think.It is true that the government has not tabled any formal proposals to the EU yet. This reinforces scepticism in Westminster that the government is serious about a deal. However, senior EU officials and negotiators were not expecting much prior to the Tory party conference, which runs from 29 September to 2 October. The critical window they have earmarked were the weeks running into the 17-18 October European heads of state meeting in Brussels, and after, until 31 October.Moreover, trial balloons floated by No 10 have made their way to the EU’s institutions and have been discussed by the 27 member states. These include radically reducing the backstop to sectoral elements and proposing a single all-Ireland regime for agriculture.David Frost, Johnson’s most senior official for European affairs and the government’s lead negotiator, has also clarified the government’s approach to Brexit, clearly setting out new parameters for the negotiation. Unlike Robbins and May, the Johnson government is not seeking “frictionless trade” with the EU while simultaneously leaving the EU’s two economic institutions that are necessary to deliver it – the customs union and the single market. Instead, Johnson and Frost only want to “facilitate” trade with the EU. They accept that Brexit will mean the UK’s access to EU markets will suffer.This is where Europe’s concerns set in. The ideas floated by No 10 suggest a trade border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. As one senior EU negotiator puts it: “The backstop means no border on the island of Ireland. But the UK’s solution will result in a customs and regulatory border – which will carry implications for peace.” This is obviously unacceptable for the EU27.The government also wants to bank the benefits of Brexit by diverging from EU rules to the maximum extent possible. Yet this has fostered the perception in EU capitals that the UK will compete with its firms by undercutting EU standards.Politically, it makes little strategic sense for the EU to compromise on the backstop – and risk its principles – if the purpose of doing so is to facilitate a deal over a bare-bones free trade agreement (FTA) that would not differ much from a no-deal outcome. “What’s the difference between no deal and a hard FTA?” ponders another adviser to an EU head of state. In no deal, the EU would at least have stuck to its principles.Once the EU factors in Johnson’s tumultuous week in parliament – that has left him heading an even weaker minority government and facing the high likelihood of an early election – it’s possible to see why its calculus is shifting it again towards a harder, less flexible position.As the UK slides painfully towards an early election, there is less scope for progress in Brussels. Any formal UK proposals will become political fodder. The EU will have to become more cautious in its response; it will not risk its interventions becoming part of the campaign. As the EU ponders events in London, its window for a deal, while open, is closing.• Mujtaba Rahman is the managing director of Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting

6799,"Boris Johnson’s claims to be conducting a Brexit renegotiation have come under fresh doubt as the UK’s closest EU ally expressed alarm at the “breathtaking” developments in Westminster and the government’s failure to table alternatives to the Irish backstop.The Dutch minister for trade, Sigrid Kaag, described the scenes being played out in London as “unbelievable” and warned of the EU’s waning patience given the impact on European businesses of the continued uncertainty.Johnson committed in early August in discussions with EU leaders to swiftly tabling an alternative solution to the Irish backstop, which would temporarily keep Northern Ireland in the single market and the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.The lack of such proposals and the attempt by the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, over the weekend to lay the blame for a lack of progress on the European commission has confirmed to many in Brussels that the outgoing work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, was right about the prime minister’s lack of seriousness in sealing a deal.In an interview with the Dutch financial newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad, Kaag warned that given the damage caused to European businesses, rebel MPs seeking to delay Brexit would need to tie it to a general election or second referendum to be sure of securing an extension of UK membership of the EU beyond 31 October.“At a point enough is enough,” Kaag said. “At that stage the certainty of deterioration might be better than continuing without perspective. At a certain point there must be clarity. A good reason is needed for a new delay. What? It is difficult to say categorically.“You have to see the context and see if there is a realistic expectation that this will lead to a follow-up phase. But so far, the British have not presented an alternative to the Brexit agreement that is already in place.”Kaag was speaking as figures from The Hague revealed companies from the United Kingdom had substantially increased their investments in the Netherlands in the last year, to a total of €80bn compared with €14bn in 2016.The UK is now the largest investor in the Netherlands. In contrast, Dutch companies divested €11bn over the last year, compared with an investment of €50bn in 2016.“The business case for Brexit is still not well-founded,” Kaag said. “People cast their votes based on an emotion or assessment without socio-economic grounds. The evidence was ignored. The damage is now clear. I think it’s dramatic.”The minister warned that the EU’s patience over the UK’s prevarication would not last forever given the impact on the bloc’s ability to steer its own way forward.Kaag said: “It is always better if you have your house in order and can say: now we are going to get involved with the Americans or prepare ourselves better for the negative consequences of the trade war between the US and China. Brexit always detracts from that.”","EU is losing patience with Britain, warns Dutch minister",2019-09-09/10:13:53,boris johnson s claims to be conducting a brexit renegotiation have come under fresh doubt as the uk s closest eu ally expressed alarm at the breathtaking developments in westminster and the government s failure to table alternatives to the irish backstop the dutch minister for trade sigrid kaag described the scenes being played out in london as unbelievable and warned of the eu s waning patience given the impact on european businesses of the continued uncertainty johnson committed in early august in discussions with eu leaders to swiftly tabling an alternative solution to the irish backstop which would temporarily keep northern ireland in the single market and the uk in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of ireland the lack of such proposals and the attempt by the brexit secretary stephen barclay over the weekend to lay the blame for a lack of progress on the european commission has confirmed to many in brussels that the outgoing work and pensions secretary amber rudd was right about the prime minister s lack of seriousness in sealing a deal in an interview with the dutch financial newspaper het financieele dagblad kaag warned that given the damage caused to european businesses rebel mps seeking to delay brexit would need to tie it to a general election or second referendum to be sure of securing an extension of uk membership of the eu beyond  october at a point enough is enough kaag said at that stage the certainty of deterioration might be better than continuing without perspective at a certain point there must be clarity a good reason is needed for a new delay what it is difficult to say categorically you have to see the context and see if there is a realistic expectation that this will lead to a follow up phase but so far the british have not presented an alternative to the brexit agreement that is already in place kaag was speaking as figures from the hague revealed companies from the united kingdom had substantially increased their investments in the netherlands in the last year to a total of bn compared with bn in  the uk is now the largest investor in the netherlands in contrast dutch companies divested bn over the last year compared with an investment of bn in  the business case for brexit is still not well founded kaag said people cast their votes based on an emotion or assessment without socio economic grounds the evidence was ignored the damage is now clear i think it s dramatic the minister warned that the eu s patience over the uk s prevarication would not last forever given the impact on the bloc s ability to steer its own way forward kaag said it is always better if you have your house in order and can say now we are going to get involved with the americans or prepare ourselves better for the negative consequences of the trade war between the us and china brexit always detracts from that ,Brexit,0.23944979906082153
6802,"Rebel ex-Conservative MPs have dismissed the idea that Boris Johnson could get around a backbench bill forcing him to seek an extension to Brexit, as they warned that more cabinet ministers could follow Amber Rudd in quitting. Johnson was heading to Dublin on Monday to meet the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, having suffered yet another political blow with the resignation of Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, over the weekend.With the Dublin trip seen as key in persuading other worried ministers that Johnson is serious about trying to negotiate a new Brexit deal, Johnson will face a sceptical reception in Ireland, with the Irish government stressing it has yet to see even the basics of a supposed replacement for the backstop border insurance policy.Rory Stewart, the former international development secretary who was among 21 Tory MPs ejected from the party for backing plans to push through the bill mandating a Brexit delay, said he believed there were other ministers considering their positions.“Yes, I think there are,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Because everybody who was in the cabinet with me and Amber, under Theresa May’s government, was very aware of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. And remember, very, very recently – barely seven weeks ago – the formal policy of the cabinet was to avoid a no-deal Brexit.”Here is the list of the 21 Conservative MPs who voted with the opposition and against the government to seize control of the parliamentary timetable in order to pave the way for a bill to block a no-deal Brexit. They were then thrown out of the party by prime minister Boris Johnson.Guto Bebb, AberconwyRichard Benyon, NewburySteve Brine, WinchesterAlistair Burt, North East BedfordshireGreg Clark, Tunbridge WellsKenneth Clarke, RushcliffeDavid Gauke, South West HertfordshireJustine Greening, PutneyDominic Grieve, BeaconsfieldSam Gyimah, East SurreyPhilip Hammond, Runnymede and WeybridgeStephen Hammond, WimbledonRichard Harrington, WatfordMargot James, StourbridgeSir Oliver Letwin, West DorsetAnne Milton, GuildfordCaroline Nokes, Romsey and Southampton NorthAntoinette Sandbach, EddisburySir Nicholas Soames, Mid SussexRory Stewart, Penrith and The BorderEdward Vaizey, WantageLater on Monday, the rebel bill that led to Stewart and others losing the Tory whip is expected to receive royal assent. It will mandate Johnson to seek a Brexit delay till 31 January if, by the middle of next month, he has not passed a departure deal or got MPs’ consent for no deal.Stewart dismissed reported ideas that Johnson – who has pledged to never seek a delay – could seek to get round the law, for example by adding a second letter to the mandated approach to the EU over an extension spelling out that he does not actually want this.“I remain very, very confident we can stop no deal. Because in the end parliament is sovereign, and we are making a positive case for a moderate, pragmatic solution to the problem,” he said.David Gauke, the former justice secretary and another key rebel, said a separate letter would be pointless given the EU would know it was not the will of parliament. “The European Union are perfectly capable of following our news stories,” he told BBC1’s Breakfast programme.Of a parallel letter, Gauke said: “It carries no weight. Statute will say that the position is that the prime minister is writing to the European Union seeking an extension. Now, of course, the European Union can refuse that extension. I personally think that they wouldn’t want to be blamed for a no-deal Brexit and they will agree to an extension.”While saying he was “very confident” that Johnson would ultimately comply with the new law, he condemned anonymous briefings that No 10 could decide to simply ignore it, calling this “damaging to our reputation”.Also speaking on Monday, the former supreme court justice Lord Sumption said it would not be legal for Johnson to apply for a Brexit extension while simultaneously trying to get the EU to reject it.“No, of course it wouldn’t,” he told Today. “The bill, or act as it’s about to become, says that he’s got to apply for an extension. Not only has he got to send the letter, he’s got to apply for an extension. To send the letter and then try to neutralise it seems to me, plainly, a breach of the act. What you’ve got to realise is the courts are not very fond of loopholes.”When he returns from Dublin later on Monday, Johnson is expected to make a second attempt to trigger a general election on 15 October by asking MPs to support a motion tabled under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.But he is almost certain to be rebuffed for a second time, after opposition leaders agreed on Friday to reject a snap poll until a no-deal Brexit has been definitively avoided.Speaking before the Dublin trip the Irish finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, told Today he remained unclear about much-touted UK government plans for alternative arrangements to replace the backstop, the guarantee against a hard Irish border, which Johnson has vowed to scrap.“What I would say to those who are putting those ideas forward is we are yet to see examples of how they would work not only on our island but anywhere else in the world,” he said.“To be in a situation where we would have one part of our island inside the single market and the other outside the single market is a very, very testing challenge for alternative arrangements.”","No-deal block cannot be circumvented, say rebel ex-Tory

6932,"A “zombie prime minister” cornered by his “own intransigence” whose failed “kamikaze strategy” had left his country facing a future that had “never looked less certain” – Europe’s media were not kind to Boris Johnson after his fourth successive Commons defeat. Le Monde said the prime minister had now “lost control of his Brexit strategy, the calendar and even of his own camp, which is deep in internal crisis”. The prime minister had warned in August the road would be bumpy, the French paper said, “but did he really expect to be buffeted to this extent, and so soon?”The first of Wednesday night’s parliamentary votes “as good as finished off Johnson’s long-promised ‘do-or-die’ Halloween Brexit,” Le Monde said. His second defeat of the evening, in which MPs refused the prime minister an early election before a no-deal Brexit was no longer possible, was “even more bitter”.Add to that the mounting fury in the Conservative party over his purge of Tory rebels, and Downing St “must surely be having doubts”, the paper concluded. Johnson may still have some options – including calling a vote of no confidence in himself – “but who outside the Westminster bubble still understands the Battle of Brexit?”Here is the list of the 21 Conservative MPs who voted with the opposition and against the government to seize control of the parliamentary timetable in order to pave the way for a bill to block a no-deal Brexit.

If he were to win a 15 October election, all now fear he might repeal or otherwise get round the new law, and trigger a no-deal Brexit.”Another was the Conservatives’ weakened position in parliament, the paper said: “Even if he calls a vote of no confidence in his own government, he still needs a majority – which he no longer has. Ultimately, the only certainty at this hour is that snap elections will happen before the end of 2019.”Italy’s Corriere della Sera said Johnson now resembled “a boxer in the corner – and he risks dragging all Britain to the mat”. The prime minister’s plan to keep no deal on the table to force Europe to accept his demands was “a kamikaze strategy: Brussels will not give up, so Britain continues to run towards the cliff edge”, the paper said.With the no-deal option rejected, Johnson turned to new elections, “but Labour refused to fall for it … And so we are faced with an impasse. He could yet try another coup, a single-line bill calling for elections. But the impression remains that his own intransigence has forced him into a corner and he no longer has much to offer his country.”Brexit, Johnson sconfitto due volte: uscita rinviata, no a voto anticipato https://t.co/ZujvG6kjAcIn Germany, the Süddeutsche Zeitung said Johnson’s early strategy had plainly failed. “How he and his advisers will react, whether he still has an ace up his sleeve, what he will do in the coming days, whether he will try to unblock things with a motion of no confidence in himself – nothing is certain,” the paper said. “But for the time being, it looks as if his power has been weakened and his freedom of action is limited.”Some warned Johnson should not be written off quite yet: an election could throw him a lifeline. Die Welt argued that the PM’s opponents may not benefit from his current “100% failure rate”. Labour’s calculation “will be that Johnson’s broken promise – ‘We leave on 31 October, do or die’ – will be punished by voters,” the paper predicted.But, it said, Johnson’s opponents “cannot rely on that. His election platform will be a brutal anti-EU campaign with a clear no-deal promise. And faced with a devoted rightwing media, growing voter frustration and an opposition that still does not know which Brexit it wants, his prospects for success are very good.”De Volkskrant said Johnson had become “a zombie prime minister”, blocked by the Commons both from maintaining a no-deal Brexit as an option and from holding elections on 15 October, and facing an increasingly rebellious party.“With no deal off the table for the time being but no elections yet, Johnson is stuck, just like Theresa May before him,” the Dutch paper said. “The Kinnock amendment, which could bring May’s agreement back for a fourth vote, may be small lifebuoy. But it was adopted automatically after the government neglected to provide tellers – an incident that summed up British politics in 2019.”Boris Johnson is een zombie-premier geworden. Het Lagerhuis dwarsboomde zowel een No Deal-Brexit op 31 oktober als vervroegde verkiezingen op 15 oktober. https://t.co/xSv828IcCQBelgium’s Le Soir said Britain was “in uncharted waters”. Johnson had been “checkmated by parliament and is without a majority”, the paper said. “Now he has been refused the early elections that he demanded. The future of Brexit – and of the country – has never been more uncertain.”The Irish Times took a look at the state of the Conservative party, which it said “can no longer lay claim to its ‘strong and stable’ mantra … It is some feat to make Corbyn look like a statesman, but the man who imagines himself after the great leaders of the ages past has managed just that.”The Tory rebels “have emerged as the real champions of conservatism”, the paper argued. “Cameron’s referendum has finally united the Tories. But it managed to unite the wrong ones behind the wrong position.

7032,"The vice-president of the European parliament has said it is unlikely there will be a new Brexit deal at the next European council summit on 17 October.Mairead McGuinness said the EU would not succumb to threats from the UK and said Boris Johnson’s approach “to take back control in a more boisterous way” than Theresa May was not the way to “yield results”.In an interview with RTÉ Radio’s Sean O’Rourke programme, McGuinness confirmed talks were intensifying in Brussels but she said they should not be mischaracterised as a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement.Under the process, Michel Barnier would need to get a new mandate from 27 EU leaders, and in the present febrile atmosphere there was no prospect of change, she said.“I don’t see why it would [change] because if you look at what that would involve, it would be mean that the democratically elected leaders of Europe would yield to a very unhelpful pressure that the British prime minister is heaping upon them, almost threatening that ‘look, we are going either way and you are going to have to deal with us,’” she told RTÉ.McGuinness said she believed Johnson’s preferred option was no deal. “If you look at some of what has been said, it seems clear to me that Prime Minister Johnson is keen for a no-deal Brexit, believing that when and if the UK leaves on that day, that discussion on the future will start immediately and he will get a free trade agreement of his choosing in a very short period of time.”She said Barnier had made it very clear in an article in the Sunday Telegraph that there would be no transition period or mini-deals if the UK crashed out on 1 November.“It is saying very clearly to the UK: if you crash out, there are consequences and don’t expect us to be lenient in eight out of 10 areas to try to facilitate a decision which will be a very disruptive decision,” she said.Lisa Chambers, the opposition party Brexit spokeswoman in Ireland, called for realism to be injected into the narrative in the UK, arguing that some in Westminster were misleading the public into thinking walking out of the EU would solve all the Irish border problems.“You cannot simply leave the EU without a deal and expect that very quickly afterwards the problems that were, such as the backstop, the border issue and protecting the single market, will evaporate into thin air. They will still need to be solved before any future trading arrangement is done,” she said.","UK's 'boisterous' efforts to get new deal will not work, says senior MEP",2019-09-02/16:50:11,the vice president of the european parliament has said it is unlikely there will be a new brexit deal at the next european council summit on  october mairead mcguinness said the eu would not succumb to threats from the uk and said boris johnson s approach to take back control in a more boisterous way than theresa may was not the way to yield results in an interview with rté radio s sean o rourke programme mcguinness confirmed talks were intensifying in brussels but she said they should not be mischaracterised as a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement under the process michel barnier would need to get a new mandate from  eu leaders and in the present febrile atmosphere there was no prospect of change she said i don t see why it would change because if you look at what that would involve it would be mean that the democratically elected leaders of europe would yield to a very unhelpful pressure that the british prime minister is heaping upon them almost threatening that look we are going either way and you are going to have to deal with us she told rté mcguinness said she believed johnson s preferred option was no deal if you look at some of what has been said it seems clear to me that prime minister johnson is keen for a no deal brexit believing that when and if the uk leaves on that day that discussion on the future will start immediately and he will get a free trade agreement of his choosing in a very short period of time she said barnier had made it very clear in an article in the sunday telegraph that there would be no transition period or mini deals if the uk crashed out on  november it is saying very clearly to the uk if you crash out there are consequences and don t expect us to be lenient in eight out of  areas to try to facilitate a decision which will be a very disruptive decision she said lisa chambers the opposition party brexit spokeswoman in ireland called for realism to be injected into the narrative in the uk arguing that some in westminster were misleading the public into thinking walking out of the eu would solve all the irish border problems you cannot simply leave the eu without a deal and expect that very quickly afterwards the problems that were such as the backstop the border issue and protecting the single market will evaporate into thin air they will still need to be solved before any future trading arrangement is done she said ,Brexit,0.31214821338653564
7326,"Boris Johnson has said the £39bn Brexit divorce bill would not “strictly speaking” be owed to Brussels in full in the event of no deal, insisting: “It’s not a threat. It’s a reality.”Speaking to broadcasters as he prepared to meet the European council president, Donald Tusk, at the G7 summit in Biarritz, Johnson said: “If we come out without an agreement it is certainly true that the £39bn is no longer, strictly speaking, owed.”He told ITV: “There will be very substantial sums available to our country to spend on our priorities. It’s not a threat. It’s a simple fact of reality.”His intervention came after Tusk warned Johnson against going down in history as “Mr No Deal”.During the Conservative leadership campaign, Johnson suggested the entire £39bn would be retained in the hope of using it as leverage to win a better future trading relationship from the EU27, saying: “Money is a great solvent and a great lubricant.”But Downing Street appears to have conceded that legal obligations for past liabilities may mean up to a quarter of it may still have to be paid.The remarks on the divorce bill are likely to infuriate Britain’s EU27 counterparts, who are still awaiting detailed proposals from London about how to maintain a soft border in Ireland after Brexit.However, Johnson claimed the chances of renegotiating Britain’s exit had improved after his trips to Berlin and Paris. “In the last few days there has been a change of mood in the EU,” he said.Asked whether negotiations should resume in Brussels – something he hopes Tusk will approve – Johnson said: “It is sensible now to get going and we will get going.”In a separate interview with the BBC, he said it was “touch and go” whether a deal could be reached in time, however – and he sought to lay the blame at the door of the EU27 if the outcome was ultimately a no-deal Brexit.“It all depends on our EU friends and partners. I think in the last few days there has been a dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals what the shape of the problem is for the UK,” he said.During his media round, Johnson also compared the challenge of Brexit to a rock he had encountered on his morning swim in the sea at the French Atlantic resort.“I swam round that rock this morning. From here you cannot tell there is a gigantic hole in that rock. There is a way through,” he said.“My point to the EU is that there is a way through, but you can’t find the way through if you just sit on the beach.”The prime minister also reiterated that the withdrawal agreement, containing what he has repeatedly referred to as the “undemocratic” backstop, must be scrapped, because it could not pass through parliament.Johnson voted for the deal himself at the third time of asking earlier this year, as did several other prominent Brexiters, including the former Brexit secretary David Davis.The prime minister is widely believed at Westminster to be drawing up plans for an early general election, in order to frustrate efforts to tie his hands on Brexit.",Boris Johnson: no deal would mean UK did not owe Brexit divorce bill,2019-08-25/12:58:52,boris johnson has said the bn brexit divorce bill would not strictly speaking be owed to brussels in full in the event of no deal insisting it s not a threat it s a reality speaking to broadcasters as he prepared to meet the european council president donald tusk at the g summit in biarritz johnson said if we come out without an agreement it is certainly true that the bn is no longer strictly speaking owed he told itv there will be very substantial sums available to our country to spend on our priorities it s not a threat it s a simple fact of reality his intervention came after tusk warned johnson against going down in history as mr no deal during the conservative leadership campaign johnson suggested the entire bn would be retained in the hope of using it as leverage to win a better future trading relationship from the eu saying money is a great solvent and a great lubricant but downing street appears to have conceded that legal obligations for past liabilities may mean up to a quarter of it may still have to be paid the remarks on the divorce bill are likely to infuriate britain s eu counterparts who are still awaiting detailed proposals from london about how to maintain a soft border in ireland after brexit however johnson claimed the chances of renegotiating britain s exit had improved after his trips to berlin and paris in the last few days there has been a change of mood in the eu he said asked whether negotiations should resume in brussels something he hopes tusk will approve johnson said it is sensible now to get going and we will get going in a separate interview with the bbc he said it was touch and go whether a deal could be reached in time however and he sought to lay the blame at the door of the eu if the outcome was ultimately a no deal brexit it all depends on our eu friends and partners i think in the last few days there has been a dawning realisation in brussels and other european capitals what the shape of the problem is for the uk he said during his media round johnson also compared the challenge of brexit to a rock he had encountered on his morning swim in the sea at the french atlantic resort i swam round that rock this morning from here you cannot tell there is a gigantic hole in that rock there is a way through he said my point to the eu is that there is a way through but you can t find the way through if you just sit on the beach the prime minister also reiterated that the withdrawal agreement containing what he has repeatedly referred to as the undemocratic backstop must be scrapped because it could not pass through parliament johnson voted for the deal himself at the third time of asking earlier this year as did several other prominent brexiters including the former brexit secretary david davis the prime minister is widely believed at westminster to be drawing up plans for an early general election in order to frustrate efforts to tie his hands on brexit ,Brexit,0.26717859506607056
7357,"Boris Johnson will sit down for breakfast on Sunday morning with a man he once famously described as “betraying a quite stupefying ignorance that makes him frankly unfit to hold the office of president of the United States”.Not too long after Johnson made that remark, Donald Trump went on to win that office. And today Johnson – having defied similar assessments of his own fitness for the highest office – will come face to face with him at the Hôtel du Palais in Biarritz, on the sidelines of the G7 summit, in his first major event on the international stage as prime minister.Both men rose to the top by portraying themselves as outsiders who were prepared to break some furniture in pursuit of an imagined national greatness. Now they must rearrange that furniture, or make some of their own.Johnson flew into Biarritz after meetings with his counterparts in Berlin and Paris, meetings which appear to have brought them no closer to a Brexit deal.At the three-day summit in Biarritz, amid the grandeur of the historic seaside resort on France’s Atlantic coast, the prime minister will be under particular scrutiny. Every word and gesture from Johnson at this annual gathering of the world’s major industrial democracies will be analysed for clues as to where he intends to position the UK on the gaping transatlantic divide between the US and Europe.If the past is any guide, the prime minister will try to avoid giving away that location, and if Trump has an interest in helping him, he will not put on him on the spot when it comes to issues and instincts on which the UK has thus far been on the European side.Those pivotal issues include UK support for the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran; backing for the Paris climate accord and acknowledgement of the urgency of the climate crisis, particularly against the blazing backdrop of the Amazon wildfires.The UK has maintained its support for an international rules-based system with multilateral institutions and free trade at its centre. It has promoted a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine and a rejection of both occupation and annexation of Palestinian territories. Britain has also maintained a firm line over the Russian military intervention in Ukraine and Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, denying Russia readmission to the G7 club until it reverses those actions.These are all shibboleths of the liberal international order, and they are being challenged daily by the Trump administration. Would a no-deal Brexit mean that Britain felt under pressure to do the same?Since taking over as prime minister, Johnson has stuck to the consensus European script on all these critical foreign policy issues.He has restated his faith in the nuclear agreement and the need to defuse tensions in the Gulf, rather than tighten the US stranglehold on Iran.Johnson has also warned against the dangers of trade wars, in the face of Trump’s worsening face-off with China, and he has stuck to European orthodoxy on the need to preserve the Paris accord on climate, and to build on it.Any substantial deviation at the G7 summit from such entrenched, shared positions would mean Johnson risking the toxic label of “poodle”, which his predecessor Tony Blair never managed to shake off.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is already framing Johnson as a “Trump first” prime minister, and there will be plenty of jilted European partners on hand to draw attention to British humiliation.Emmanuel Macron, when asked last week if he thought that Johnson and Trump would team up together in a united front against other Europeans at the G7, played on deep British fears about the future.“I don’t think it’s Boris Johnson’s project or the British people’s project, as Britain leaves the EU saying it wants a bigger space in the world, to then become the junior partner of the US,” the French president told reporters last week.He said any future trade deal between the US and the UK would not make up for the UK’s geographical and strategic links to Europe, and a trade deal with the US could come at a high price for Britain: a “historic vassalisation” to the US.It is unlikely Macron chose his words carelessly. Johnson first signalled his break from Theresa May at the end of 2017 by warning that the UK must not become a “vassal state” of Europe. With the EU, the UK had one of the bigger seats at the table, but in the absence of a withdrawal agreement with Europe, Britain approaches the US as a junior partner at best, a supplicant at worst.Johnson has insisted that he will defend British agriculture and the National Health Service against the predations of US corporations, but that will be harder if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal, a course of action Trump and his administration have repeatedly advocated. Johnson’s readiness to embrace such an outcome distinguishes him from Theresa May, and is arguably the most important reason Trump openly preferred him to his predecessor.On this issue at least, Johnson has, with his brinksmanship, placed himself closer to Trump and further from the EU. The European Council president, Donald Tusk, drily noted that when he meets Johnson on Sunday, he will be the third Tory prime minister with whom he has sat down to discuss Brexit. He warned Johnson on Saturday that he risked going down in history as “Mr No Deal”.On the way to Biarritz, Johnson sought to defend his strategy of blaming Britain’s EU partners for failing to come up with a solution to the Irish backstop impasse.“I don’t want a no-deal Brexit but I say to our EU friends if they don’t want no deal they have got to get rid of the backstop from the treaty,” Johnson told reporters. “If Donald Tusk doesn’t want to go down in history as Mr No-Deal Brexit, then I hope this point will be borne in mind by him too.”Trump, ironically for a self-proclaimed master of the deal, can be expected to continue to pull in the other direction, seeking to persuade the prime minister that “Mr No Deal” would be a badge of pride.In the absence of specifics, both Trump and Johnson will seek to play up the manly bonhomie of a renewed “special relationship”. The US president will want to show he has at least one friend in Biarritz, the man he proudly referred to as “Britain [sic] Trump”, and has shown that he is prepared to overlook past slights in special circumstances.For his part, Johnson – who declared only a few years ago that the only reason he would avoid some parts of New York was “the real risk of meeting Donald Trump” – must seek to show he can connect more successfully with the US president that his hapless predecessor.Both men will paint a rosy picture of a future US-UK trade deal, because the ugly reality of the negotiations can be put off until later. At some point post-Brexit, the UK will have to make a decision on whether its regulatory standards are to converge with the US or with the EU.It cannot do both. Converging with the US would be likely to involve breaking promises about British food, agriculture and animal welfare as well as the National Health Service.Moreover, any trade deal with the US would have to gain approval from Congress, and the House of Representatives will be in no mood to cooperate if Brexit has an impact on the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland. The Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, has repeatedly said there is “no way whatsoever” a US-UK free trade deal would be approved if Brexit affected the border between the two Irelands.So whatever the upbeat noises about future trade Trump and Johnson make on Sunday, it will mean little in real terms. The rest will be mood music, and Johnson has shown himself adept in that department. The G7 is a big stage, but not a particularly challenging act. There are set scripts and orthodoxies to follow.But as ever, Trump is the wild card, constantly threatening to upset the comfortable western consensus of years past. If he so chooses, the president could set the rejuvenated special relationship with the man he has frequently called his friend, and force Johnson to make the hard choices he is hoping to postpone until after an election.",Boris Johnson prepares for Biarritz balancing act with Donald Trump,2019-08-24/19:00:46,boris johnson will sit down for breakfast on sunday morning with a man he once

7476,"The European Union has rebuffed Boris Johnson’s attempts to tear up the Irish backstop, in a coordinated response that appeared to close the door on further meaningful Brexit negotiations.In remarks shortly before the prime minister departed for a whistle-stop tour to meet European leaders, Johnson put the blame for the EU’s hardline response at the feet of Conservative rebels, claiming his negotiating strategy was being undermined by those who said they could prevent no deal.The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, accused the British government of failing to admit that its policies would lead to the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.As the standoff played out, the government confirmed that British officials would stop attending most EU meetings from 1 September, a move denounced by critics as showing contempt for British influence in Brussels and allies across Europe.Johnson suggested the EU’s position was influenced by the manoeuvres of Conservative MPs who have been examining legislative methods to stop no deal in the House of Commons, including former cabinet ministers like Philip Hammond.Downing Street has insisted that leaving on 31 October cannot be stopped by any means, even if parliament were to pass legislation.“One thing that slightly, I think, complicates the picture is that our EU friends still clearly think that there is a possibility that parliament will block Brexit,” the prime minister said. “And as long as they think there’s a possibility that parliament will block Brexit they are unlikely to be minded to make the concessions that we need. So it is going to take a bit of patience.”The standoff set the stage for tense encounters between Johnson and Angela Merkel in Berlin and Emmanuel Macron in Paris, before a gathering of G7 leaders on Saturday.The German chancellor is expected to dismiss Johnson’s call to scrap the backstop when she meets him on Wednesday.“The letter to the president of the European council is not a serious offer, and Boris Johnson knows it,” said Norbert Röttgen, an ally of Merkel who heads the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee. “If Johnson really wanted to achieve something on his visits to Paris and Berlin, he would have been well advised against writing this letter.”Variously described as an insurance policy or safety net, the backstop is a device in the withdrawal agreement intended to ensure that there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, even if no formal deal can be reached on trade and security arrangements.It would mean that if there were no workable agreement on such matters, Northern Ireland would stay in the customs union and much of the single market, guaranteeing a friction-free border with the Republic. This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU’s customs union permanently if the UK & EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc. Joint interpretative instrument A legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try to get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU’s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.Unilateral statement from the UK This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.Additional language in political declaration This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like. However, it failed to persuade the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who said that while it ‘reduces the risk’ of the UK being trapped in a backstop indefinitely, it does not remove it.Boris Johnson declared the Northern Ireland backstop ‘dead’ during his leadership campaign, and promised to throw it out of any deal he renegotiated with the EU. The EU has repeatedly stated that it will not reopen the withdrawal agreement for renegotiation. Daniel Boffey, Martin Belam and Peter Walker Tusk, who is also expected to meet Johnson this weekend, wrote: “The backstop is an insurance to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland unless and until an alternative is found. Those against the backstop and not proposing realistic alternatives in fact support re-establishing a border. Even if they do not admit it.”In a sign of the EU’s carefully coordinated response, the European commission issued its own statement minutes later saying it shared Tusk’s view.A commission spokeswoman welcomed the UK government’s “engagement and commitment to an orderly withdrawal” while making clear its objections.“We also note that the letter does not provide a legal operational solution to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland,” she said. “It does not set out what any alternative arrangements could be and in fact it recognises that there is no guarantee that such arrangements will be in place by the end of the transitional period.”Johnson admitted that the EU’s position was “a bit negative” but suggested Brussels must acknowledge the deal had been summarily rejected by the UK parliament.“I saw what Donald Tusk had to say, and it wasn’t redolent of a sense of optimism,” he said. “But I think, actually, we will get there. I think there’s a real sense now that something needs to be done with this backstop.”The prime minister said the UK had no intention of introducing any sort of new border checks or infrastructure at the Irish border. “It’s a bit of a paradox because it is the other side, a bit odd, the other side of the argument, the EU, who seem to think it might be necessary to have checks for them to preserve the integrity of the single market,” he said.Johnson had dashed any prospect of an early compromise in a letter on Monday night when he called on the EU to scrap the backstop, which he said was anti-democratic and “inconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK as a state”.The letter was addressed to Tusk, who chairs EU summits. Copies were also sent to EU27 leaders and the head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.As the EU made its first public statements, diplomats from the 27 countries were sent an analysis that described key arguments in Johnson’s letter as incorrect and misleading.The internal document seen by the Guardian states it was “incorrect” to suggest the people of Northern Ireland would have no influence over EU laws that applied to them, pointing to provisions in the Brexit agreement.Officials had already strongly rejected Johnson’s claim that the backstop was anti-democratic, pointing to the fact Northern Ireland had voted to remain in the EU and non-unionist parties were in favour of the backstop.Johnson’s claim that it would be possible for two separate legal and economic jurisdictions to exist on the island of Ireland with an open border was judged “misleading” as EU law provided “the common framework needed to enable frictionless trade between member states today”.While the EU has said it was ready to examine alternative arrangements to the backstop, officials have stressed that no such options exist today anywhere in the world.Neale Richmond, an Irish senator, said Johnson’s claim that the backstop posed a threat to the Good Friday agreement was “very disappointing language”.“The negotiations ended in November,” he told BBC Radio 4. “The British government in good faith agreed the withdrawal agreement. And the backstop isn’t impossible to get out of; that is simply misleading. However, it cannot be unilaterally exited by one state. What’s the point of the backstop if one side can simply just rip it up?”He ruled out a time limit on the backstop. “It is an insurance policy to protect a very fragile peace deal, therefore it needs the buy-in of both sides, because both the British and Irish government are co-guarantors of that Good Friday agreement.”An Irish government source played down the significance of Johnson’s letter, saying: “The letter just reiterates the British government’s position. The EU position remains clear. The withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated and the backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement.”The backstop was consistent with the Good Friday agreement and did not undermine the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, an analysis that London shared during and after negotiations, the source said. “It’s disappointing that the British government cannot stand over the commitment it gave in 2017 and 2018.”Guy Verhofstadt, who chairs the European parliament’s Brexit steering group, tweeted he did not see any majority in the UK parliament to remove the backstop. “It is a vital insurance policy, negotiated in good faith and supported by the people of the island of Ireland. The time for bluster and political blame games is fast running out.”Last week a leaked German government paper revealed that Berlin saw a “high probability” of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October as it was currently unforeseeable that Johnson would change his “tough negotiating position”.Additional reporting by Rory Carroll in Dublin and Philip Oltermann in Berlin.",EU rejects Boris Johnson request to

7485,"As the UK races towards a potential no-deal Brexit, President Donald Trump is cheering it on. But Brexit – especially without a deal in place with the European Union – would be bad for the US-UK special relationship and would make the UK a much less important US ally.The ramifications of Brexit – in particular without a deal with the EU that pleases everyone – could be explosive. It could hurt the UK economy at a time when Trump’s trade war and economic policies are increasing the risk of a global recession, and threaten the very integrity of the UK amid growing signals that Northern Ireland and Scotland would consider breaking away. Boris Johnson appears willing to drive Britain off this cliff come hell or high water, threatening a no-deal Brexit and saying that the UK will leave the EU by the end of October, “do or die”. Everyone hopes that the UK finds a way out of this mess, but the past few years haven’t provided much evidence to believe that it will end well.Trump has long supported Brexit. He made that support clear during his presidential campaign and has expressed it repeatedly as president. Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, now appears to be doing what he can to ensure Brexit happens. When in the UK recently, Bolton tried to incentivise Brexit by dangling the possibility of a trade deal with the US after the UK leaves the EU, saying that the UK would be at the “front of the trade queue” for a deal.But that won’t happen. First, the politics in the US right now mean that it is incredibly difficult to pass any trade deals, even with America’s closest allies. Second, and more important, US congressional leaders have already signalled that a deal would be dead on arrival in Congress if Brexit affects the situation in Northern Ireland. As the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said: “If Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be no chance of a US-UK trade agreement passing the Congress.”In fact, the reality of a post-Brexit US-UK alliance could be just the opposite of the false promises being peddled by Trump and Bolton: the longer-term impacts of Brexit could include a significantly downgraded relationship between the two nations. It’s been a long time since the UK was the global power it once was, but it’s still a vital US ally. From diplomatic cooperation at the UN, to supporting the Iran nuclear deal, to working together in Nato, there are endless examples of how a strong alliance – and a strong UK – is in the US interest.But if the UK leaves the EU – especially without a deal – its influence and power will decrease markedly. It would no longer be able to influence EU decisions on economic matters in a bloc that constitutes the world’s second largest economy and with which the US traded $1.3tn in goods and services in 2018. It would no longer be able to influence the EU position on challenges such as Russia and China. If a no-deal Brexit causes a rift within the UK by pushing Scotland towards independence or undermining the Good Friday agreement, it will have even less bandwidth to play a positive role around the world. And if Brexit damages the UK economy, it will likely mean a UK with less global economic and military power.While a post-Brexit UK is still likely to be one of the world’s largest economies and will retain its seat on the UN security council, it will be less important to US national security and economic interests. In addition, if the UK and EU remain at odds over significant economic and political issues in the wake of Brexit, it could place the US in an awkward position between close allies in the UK and on the rest of the continent.Furthermore, Brexit won’t make the serious policy disagreements between the Trump administration and the UK magically disappear. For instance, the two have been at odds over the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and whether to allow the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to do business in Britain. It seems unlikely that the Trump administration would be willing to give the UK a break on those issues in the event of Brexit – just look at the recent spat with Britain over whether to release an Iranian oil tanker detained in Gibraltar.While some might believe that Trump and Johnson’s relationship as kindred demagogic spirits could help buoy the alliance in the wake of Brexit, it should be clear by now that the two leaders are driven by their own political interests and are willing to damage the special relationship if it advances their own personal positions.Trump has no interest in the US-UK alliance – he’s an agent of chaos, and supporting Brexit is yet another way for him to upend international norms. Trump’s disdain for allies should be fair warning to those who think the president might be willing to offer fair trade terms to Britain. As analyst Jeremy Shapiro points out, what we know so far about the terms for a US-UK deal “reveals that it is very much an ‘America first’ effort”. Faith in Trump to help a US ally is misplaced. “Our allies take advantage of us far more than our enemies,” Trump said at a recent rally.If the current UK government believes that the US will shower rewards on Britain in the wake of Brexit, or that it will somehow bail Britain out, they’re wrong. Many policymakers in America will stick with the UK because of the longstanding alliance, but it could be a diminished alliance. And that would be bad for both countries.• Michael H Fuchs is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and a former deputy assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs",Donald Trump’s UK trade promises are hot air – his aim is Brexit chaos,2019-08-20/15:23:03,as the uk races towards a potential no deal brexit president donald trump is cheering it on but brexit especially without a deal in place with the european union would be bad for the us uk special relationship and would make the uk a much less important us ally the ramifications of brexit in particular without a deal with the eu that pleases everyone could be explosive it could hurt the uk economy at a time when trump s trade war and economic policies are increasing the risk of a global recession and threaten the very integrity of the uk amid growing signals that northern ireland and scotland would consider breaking away boris johnson appears willing to drive britain off this cliff come hell or high water threatening a no deal brexit and saying that the uk will leave the eu by the end of october do or die everyone hopes that the uk finds a way out of this mess but the past few years haven t provided much evidence to believe that it will end well trump has long supported brexit he made that support clear during his presidential campaign and has expressed it repeatedly as president trump s national security adviser john bolton now appears to be doing what he can to ensure brexit happens when in the uk recently bolton tried to incentivise brexit by dangling the possibility of a trade deal with the us after the uk leaves the eu saying that the uk would be at the front of the trade queue for a deal but that won t happen first the politics in the us right now mean that it is incredibly difficult to pass any trade deals even with america s closest allies second and more important us congressional leaders have already signalled that a deal would be dead on arrival in congress if brexit affects the situation in northern ireland as the speaker of the house of representatives nancy pelosi said if brexit undermines the good friday accord there will be no chance of a us uk trade agreement passing the congress in fact the reality of a post brexit us uk alliance could be just the opposite of the false promises being peddled by trump and bolton the longer term impacts of brexit could include a significantly downgraded relationship between the two nations it s been a long time since the uk was the global power it once was but it s still a vital us ally from diplomatic cooperation at the un to supporting the iran nuclear deal to working together in nato there are endless examples of how a strong alliance and a strong uk is in the us interest but if the uk leaves the eu especially without a deal its influence and power will decrease markedly it would no longer be able to influence eu decisions on economic matters in a bloc that constitutes the world s second largest economy and with which the us traded  tn in goods and services in  it would no longer be able to influence the eu position on challenges such as russia and china if a no deal brexit causes a rift within the uk by pushing scotland towards independence or undermining the good friday agreement it will have even less bandwidth to play a positive role around the world and if brexit damages the uk economy it will likely mean a uk with less global economic and military power while a post brexit uk is still likely to be one of the world s largest economies and will retain its seat on the un security council it will be less important to us national security and economic interests in addition if the uk and eu remain at odds over significant economic and political issues in the wake of brexit it could place the us in an awkward position between close allies in the uk and on the rest of the continent furthermore brexit won t make the serious policy disagreements between the trump administration and the uk magically disappear for instance the two have been at odds over the us withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal and whether to allow the chinese telecommunications company huawei to do business in britain it seems unlikely that the trump administration would be willing to give the uk a break on those issues in the event of brexit just look at the recent spat with britain over whether to release an iranian oil tanker detained in gibraltar while some might believe that trump and johnson s relationship as kindred demagogic spirits could help buoy the alliance in the wake of brexit it should be clear by now that the two leaders are driven by their own political interests and are willing to damage the special relationship if it advances their own personal positions trump has no interest in the us uk alliance he s an agent of chaos and supporting brexit is yet another way for him to upend international norms trump s disdain for allies should be fair warning to those who think the president might be willing to offer fair trade terms to britain as analyst jeremy shapiro points out what we know so far about the terms for a us uk deal reveals that it is very much an america first effort faith in trump to help a us ally is misplaced our allies take advantage of us far more than our enemies trump said at a recent rally if the current uk government believes that the us will shower rewards on britain in the wake of brexit or that it will somehow bail britain out they re wrong many policymakers in america will stick with the uk

7531,"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can also catch our monthly Brexit Means … podcast here. And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.Jeremy Corbyn will promise to do “everything necessary to stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit” as he delivers a speech on Monday in which he will accuse Boris Johnson of being a “fake populist and phoney outsider” in the mould of Donald Trump.The Labour leader will give a flagship speech in the key marginal seat of Corby in the east Midlands as speculation grows about an election in the coming weeks.Following the leak of documents warning of protests and food shortages in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Corbyn will attack Johnson for the Conservative party’s “failure on Brexit, and its lurch to the hard right, which has provoked the crisis our country faces this autumn”.The shadow chancellor said on Monday morning that Labour wanted to see parliament reconvened “in the next few days” to work to avoid a no-deal Brexit.But John McDonnell insisted during an interview on the BBC’s Today programme that it was “non-negotiable” that the Labour leader should be the figure who leads any caretaker government that could emerge.Downing Street has blamed the disclosure of detailed preparations being made under Operation Yellowhammer on a hostile former minister intent on ruining Johnson’s trip to see EU leaders this week as he also prepares to make his debut at a G7 summit.The leaked document argues that the most likely scenario is severe extended delays to medicine supplies and shortages of some fresh foods, combined with price rises, if there is a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.Michael Gove, the cabinet minister responsible for no-deal planning, insisted Yellowhammer represented a “worst-case scenario” and said “significant” steps had been taken in the last three weeks to accelerate planning.But separate leaks also show that planning of a different kind – for a general election – is being ramped up.The prime minister’s No 10 operation is increasingly on an election footing, with leaked internal emails revealing he was due to meet Sir Lynton Crosby, the election guru who worked on the campaigns of David Cameron in 2015 and Theresa May in 2017.Johnson’s planned meetings with the French president and German chancellor come ahead of the G7 summit in Biarritz at the end of the week, where the PM is likely to meet the US president, Donald Trump, for talks about a potential post-Brexit trade deal.The general assumption of observers is that no one should expect a breakthrough from Johnson’s visits to Berlin and Paris to meet Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. He is scheduled to hold a working lunch on Thursday with Macron at the Elysée and issue a joint declaration.In terms of political positioning, he is expected to cling to a hardline message on Brexit and the intention of his government for Britain to leave on 31 October.For now, his position is that formal talks on Brexit will only take place until the Northern Ireland backstop is removed from the withdrawal agreement negotiated by his predecessor in No 10.Don’t expect much in the way of comment from European leaders about Operation Yellowhammer, although the Financial Times reports one senior EU official as saying that Johnson must come to the G7 with a credible proposal to prevent a hard border in Ireland.“The first thing to know is what detailed plan on avoiding a hard border Johnson has in mind – a plan that is compatible with the existing withdrawal agreement,” the official said.Looking ahead to the G7, where the ever-unpredictable Trump is likely to give an edge to proceedings, the summit marks the first real test of Johnson on the international stage (although other states will be familiar with his approach from his time as foreign secretary). One scenario being sketched out by some was the possibility of a Trump-Johnson alliance of sorts.Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP who chairs the influential Commons foreign affairs committee, said it would be interesting to see if the meeting of leaders became “another six and one, or five and two” with the UK becoming even more part of the “American camp”.Tugendhat told the BBC’s Today programme that the UK could play the role, as it had done in the past, of a “bridge” between other states and the US.That’s not quite a scenario other European leaders appear to be contemplating. British officials have been liaising with their EU counterparts on how to get on the right side of the trade war between the US and China, and are already treading a diplomatic fine line over the European-backed Iranian nuclear deal opposed by Trump.“This is a diplomatic quagmire of a G7,” one European diplomat told the Guardian.All is meanwhile being done in Brussels to get things right on the European side and to avoid a repetition of the Salzburg summit where Theresa May was seen to have been humiliated.“A frosty approach would be self-defeating,” an EU official said, while admitting that Donald Tusk, president of the European council, who will also attend, did not always toe the line.Avoiding no deal must be the “number one priority” for the government, according to Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI.The home secretary, Priti Patel, is pressing for freedom of movement by European nationals into the UK to end on 31 October under a no-deal Brexit, according to reports.Dominic Grieve has accused Johnson of “behaving like a demagogue” and said the UK prime minister’s rhetoric had led directly to him receiving death threats.As many as 40 Tory MPs are backing an attempt led by two former cabinet ministers, Philip Hammond and David Gauke, to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, the Telegraph has reported.British house hunters have launched a surprise August buying spree before the scheduled Brexit date, with new data showing sales reached their highest point since 2015 during the usually sleepy summer period.Brexit party politicians have appeared on programmes that have hosted conspiracy theorists and promoted the views of prominent figures on the hard right, an analysis has found.The Democratic Unionist party has been attempting to play down the results of a poll that found almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.As many as 40,000 motorists in Ireland who are still driving with a UK licence are being warned they have just weeks to exchange it or face being put off the road in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, has said that other members of parliament must return to the House of Commons to hold an “increasingly reckless” Boris Johnson to account.Matthew d’Ancona, the Guardian columnist and chairman of the Conservative thinktank Bright Blue, argues that what matters now is how those in politics who want to prevent the UK experiencing a “historic disaster” respond to the challenge; how imaginative they are prepared to be; and whether they are ready to put nation before party:Let us address the bearded elephant in the room. I think I have made it fairly clear that I do not want Jeremy Corbyn to become prime minister and that I firmly believe he is not up to the job. But – if Johnson loses a vote of no confidence in September, triggering a 14-day period in which, by law, any MP can seek to form an alternative government – it is self-evident that Corbyn will be at the heart of any such discussions, ex officio, as leader of the opposition. I might wish that Stella Creasy or Yvette Cooper or Hilary Benn held that post. But none of them does.With such a high-profile journalist as @OwenJones84 being subject to a premeditated attack, it's worth remembering that journalists were among the very first targets of fascists - some murdered in direct retribution for their criticism. /1 pic.twitter.com/8OCWBBWtB2",Brexit weekly briefing: Corbyn promises to do 'everything necessary' to stop no

7567,"For weeks things have been quiet in the summer heat. But in recent days the normal diplomatic back-channelling between London, Brussels, Paris, Berlin and Rome has cranked into gear before the G7 meeting in Biarritz of the world’s most advanced economies.British officials have been liaising with their EU counterparts on how to get on the right side of the trade war between the US and China, tread a diplomatic fine line over the European-backed Iranian nuclear deal opposed by Donald Trump and get the rhetoric right on the precarious situation in Hong Kong in the presence of the Chinese leader Xi Jinping. “This is a diplomatic quagmire of a G7,” said a European diplomat.But that quagmire is not restricted to the US, Canada and Japan. Britain and the other EU countries in attendance – France, Germany and Italy – have plenty of tensions of their own.“They were nervous, and that makes us nervous,” an EU source said of talks with officials in Whitehall about Boris Johnson’s first appearance as a head of government on the world stage.There is currently no relationship between the power players in the EU and the new British government, and there is very little trust.Everything that Johnson has done so far in power is seen as being for domestic consumption, and, to a large extent, that is expected to continue. Some fear a “big moment” from Johnson in Biarritz at which he seeks to blame Brussels for the Brexit impasse and help along the dangerous slide to a no-deal exit.But hope also springs eternal that the new prime minister will at some point add some ballast to the claim that he genuinely wants to leave the European Union with a deal. Biarritz is again seen as being as good a point as any.“We believe that the UK is willing to leave the EU on 31 October,” a source said. “We do not have any evidence yet that the UK wants to negotiate a deal.”All is being done in Brussels to get things right on the European side and to avoid a repetition of the Salzburg summit where Theresa May was seen to have been humiliated. “A frosty approach would be self-defeating,” an EU official said, while admitting that Donald Tusk, president of the European council, who will also attend, doesn’t always toe the line.Everything has been contemplated, from the tone of the speeches to how to deal with an unlikely, but not unthinkable, attempt by Trump to give “the art of the deal” a go in the Brexit negotiations.Perhaps those meetings and Biarritz will be a reality check for JohnsonOn the British side, there appears to be some willing. Johnson is to speak on the phone to Ireland’s prime minister Leo Varadkar as well as to Tusk this week.More significantly, he will leave the comfort of Downing Street and the bubble of advisers led by Dominic Cummings for Paris and Berlin to meet Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel for the first time since becoming prime minister. “Perhaps those meetings and Biarritz will be a reality check,” said an EU diplomat intimately involved in the Brexit negotiations.Johnson’s claims to want to renegotiate the deal appear empty so far given his insistence that the UK will leave on 31 October, which leaves little time for a serious rethink. There have not been any proposals sent Brussels’ way.“They have made it easy for the EU side in a way,” said a source. “If they came up with a 15-year time limit on the backstop or some way in which the people of Northern Ireland had a regular opportunity to vote in favour of exiting the backstop, you might have some more difficult conversations.“But that is a million miles from where we are.”When Johnson’s EU adviser David Frost visited Brussels recently he admitted that even without the backstop there was no guarantee the withdrawal agreement would be backed by parliament.“So the position is get rid of the backstop and then we will see what else we don’t like?” asked one diplomat. “Where’s the incentive for us?”In reality, August may just be an ordeal to get through for both sides. “It depends on what Boris Johnson really wants,” a rueful diplomat concluded.",G7 leaders wait nervously for Boris Johnson’s debut on the world stage,2019-08-18/09:00:06,for weeks things have been quiet in the summer heat but in recent days the normal diplomatic back channelling between london brussels paris berlin and rome has cranked into gear before the g meeting in biarritz of the world s most advanced economies british officials have been liaising with their eu counterparts on how to get on the right side of the trade war between the us and china tread a diplomatic fine line over the european backed iranian nuclear deal opposed by donald trump and get the rhetoric right on the precarious situation in hong kong in the presence of the chinese leader xi jinping this is a diplomatic quagmire of a g said a european diplomat but that quagmire is not restricted to the us canada and japan britain and the other eu countries in attendance france germany and italy have plenty of tensions of their own they were nervous and that makes us nervous an eu source said of talks with officials in whitehall about boris johnson s first appearance as a head of government on the world stage there is currently no relationship between the power players in the eu and the new british government and there is very little trust everything that johnson has done so far in power is seen as being for domestic consumption and to a large extent that is expected to continue some fear a big moment from johnson in biarritz at which he seeks to blame brussels for the brexit impasse and help along the dangerous slide to a no deal exit but hope also springs eternal that the new prime minister will at some point add some ballast to the claim that he genuinely wants to leave the european union with a deal biarritz is again seen as being as good a point as any we believe that the uk is willing to leave the eu on  october a source said we do not have any evidence yet that the uk wants to negotiate a deal all is being done in brussels to get things right on the european side and to avoid a repetition of the salzburg summit where theresa may was seen to have been humiliated a frosty approach would be self defeating an eu official said while admitting that donald tusk president of the european council who will also attend doesn t always toe the line everything has been contemplated from the tone of the speeches to how to deal with an unlikely but not unthinkable attempt by trump to give the art of the deal a go in the brexit negotiations perhaps those meetings and biarritz will be a reality check for johnsonon the british side there appears to be some willing johnson is to speak on the phone to ireland s prime minister leo varadkar as well as to tusk this week more significantly he will leave the comfort of downing street and the bubble of advisers led by dominic cummings for paris and berlin to meet emmanuel macron and angela merkel for the first time since becoming prime minister perhaps those meetings and biarritz will be a reality check said an eu diplomat intimately involved in the brexit negotiations johnson s claims to want to renegotiate the deal appear empty so far given his insistence that the uk will leave on  october which leaves little time for a serious rethink there have not been any proposals sent brussels way they have made it easy for the eu side in a way said a source if they came up with a  year time limit on the backstop or some way in which the people of northern ireland had a regular opportunity to vote in favour of exiting the backstop you might have some more difficult conversations but that is a million miles from where we are when johnson s eu adviser david frost visited brussels recently he admitted that even without the backstop there was no guarantee the withdrawal agreement would be backed by parliament so the position is get rid of the backstop and then we will see what else we don t like asked one diplomat where s the incentive for us in reality august may just be an ordeal to get through for both sides it depends on what boris johnson really wants a rueful diplomat concluded ,Brexit,0.2350071668624878
7701,"Philip Hammond has told Boris Johnson that leaving the EU without a deal would be a betrayal of the referendum result, as the former chancellor led a group of 20 Conservatives making clear their opposition to crashing out on 31 October.In a sign that some Tory MPs are determined to block a no-deal Brexit, Hammond appeared to blame Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s senior adviser, for making demands for a new deal that the EU “cannot and will not accede to”.Writing in the Times, he said: “The hardliners may make the most noise but they are not the most numerous. Most people in this country want to see us leave in a smooth and orderly fashion that will not disrupt lives, cost jobs or diminish living standards, whether they voted leave or remain in 2016. No deal would be a betrayal of the 2016 referendum result. It must not happen.”In an apparent swipe at Cummings, he said: “The unelected people who pull the strings of this government know that this is a demand the EU cannot, and will not, accede to. Not just because they will be stubborn in their defence of the single market (although they will), but because the fragility of their own coalition of 27 means any attempt on their side to reopen the package would see their unity collapse. They will not take that chance and the smart people in Whitehall know it.”A senior Downing Street source said: “Philip Hammond actively undermined the government’s negotiating position by frustrating and obstructing preparation to leave the EU. Everyone knows that the ex-chancellor’s real objective was to cancel the referendum result.”The former chancellor is leading a group of 20 Tories, including seven former cabinet ministers, who have written to Johnson accusing him of setting the bar too high in negotiations with the EU to have a hope of getting changes to a deal.Signed by Greg Clark, David Gauke, Rory Stewart and others, the letter says: “We are alarmed by the ‘red lines’ you have drawn which, on the face of it, appear to eliminate the chance of reaching agreement with the EU”.The intervention is a sign that Tories opposed to a no-deal Brexit are prepared to vote with opposition parties to prevent Johnson taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October without a deal.At the same time, John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, vowed at an Edinburgh festival fringe event to fight attempts to sideline parliament “with every breath in my body”. He said he would insist on the right of parliament to continue to sit and debate.Cummings, the architect of the Vote Leave campaign, has told staff in No 10 that the rebels are too late to stop a no-deal Brexit, as the prime minister could simply push it through on 31 October and hold an election afterwards.However, his opponents are incensed by the idea that parliament could be sidelined and have been working over the summer on ways to prevent that happening. These include a confidence vote to replace Johnson as prime minister with a temporary government or passing a law to force him to extend article 50.Johnson insists that he wants a deal with the EU but only one that does not include the “undemocratic backstop” – the insurance mechanism to stop a hard border on the island of Ireland that Brussels says must be a part of the deal.Since taking office, the prime minster has ramped up preparations for leaving without a deal in a move to convince the EU he is serious about leaving on 31 October regardless of whether the UK has a withdrawal agreement in place.","No-deal Brexit would be a betrayal, says Philip Hammond",2019-08-13/23:36:42,philip hammond has told boris johnson that leaving the eu without a deal would be a betrayal of the referendum result as the former chancellor led a group of  conservatives making clear their opposition to crashing out on  october in a sign that some tory mps are determined to block a no deal brexit hammond appeared to blame dominic cummings johnson s senior adviser for making demands for a new deal that the eu cannot and will not accede to writing in the times he said the hardliners may make the most noise but they are not the most numerous most people in this country want to see us leave in a smooth and orderly fashion that will not disrupt lives cost jobs or diminish living standards whether they voted leave or remain in  no deal would be a betrayal of the  referendum result it must not happen in an apparent swipe at cummings he said the unelected people who pull the strings of this government know that this is a demand the eu cannot and will not accede to not just because they will be stubborn in their defence of the single market although they will but because the fragility of their own coalition of  means any attempt on their side to reopen the package would see their unity collapse they will not take that chance and the smart people in whitehall know it a senior downing street source said philip hammond actively undermined the government s negotiating position by frustrating and obstructing preparation to leave the eu everyone knows that the ex chancellor s real objective was to cancel the referendum result the former chancellor is leading a group of  tories including seven former cabinet ministers who have written to johnson accusing him of setting the bar too high in negotiations with the eu to have a hope of getting changes to a deal signed by greg clark david gauke rory stewart and others the letter says we are alarmed by the red lines you have drawn which on the face of it appear to eliminate the chance of reaching agreement with the eu the intervention is a sign that tories opposed to a no deal brexit are prepared to vote with opposition parties to prevent johnson taking the uk out of the eu on  october without a deal at the same time john bercow the speaker of the house of commons vowed at an edinburgh festival fringe event to fight attempts to sideline parliament with every breath in my body he said he would insist on the right of parliament to continue to sit and debate cummings the architect of the vote leave campaign has told staff in no  that the rebels are too late to stop a no deal brexit as the prime minister could simply push it through on  october and hold an election afterwards however his opponents are incensed by the idea that parliament could be sidelined and have been working over the summer on ways to prevent that happening these include a confidence vote to replace johnson as prime minister with a temporary government or passing a law to force him to extend article  johnson insists that he wants a deal with the eu but only one that does not include the undemocratic backstop the insurance mechanism to stop a hard border on the island of ireland that brussels says must be a part of the deal since taking office the prime minster has ramped up preparations for leaving without a deal in a move to convince the eu he is serious about leaving on  october regardless of whether the uk has a withdrawal agreement in place ,Brexit,0.2920975983142853

But his top aide, Dominic Cummings, said the government could call elections for after 31 October and leave anyway if it loses a confidence vote.Michael Gove, in charge of no-deal preparations, ramped up the rhetoric, accusing the EU 27 of intransigence and calling it “wrong and sad”, while the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, insisted during a visit to the US that Brexit would bring “a huge series of upsides” for the UK in international trade.As the Irish government again said the backstop would not be up for renegotiation at a meeting next month between the PM and Leo Varadkar, No 10 reinforced its “do or die” Brexit message by suggesting that UK diplomats would be pulled out of the EU’s institutional structures of power in Brussels within days.It was also revealed that Johnson’s chief of staff had cancelled all leave for Downing Street advisers until 31 October, further increasing already fevered speculation about the likelihood of a snap election in the aftermath of a no-deal Brexit.Meanwhile, fears that the UK could be heading for its first recession in a decade were stoked by grim official figures showing that the economy had contracted in the second quarter – and parliamentary resistance to the Johnson/Cummings plan stiffened.A cross-party group of MPs began working on a plan to thwart a no-deal Brexit on 31 October by forcing parliament to sit through the autumn recess, while Jeremy Corbyn wrote to the cabinet secretary saying a no-deal Brexit during an election campaign would be an “unprecedented, unconstitutional and anti-democratic abuse of power”.Labour said it was talking to other opposition groups about a possible rapid vote of no confidence against Boris Johnson once parliament returns in September, and the “rebel alliance” began mulling over new governments, emergency legislation, breaches of convention and court cases – while being unsure whether no deal can be averted.The Institute for Government also warned that a no-deal Brexit now appeared increasingly likely given the lack of time to secure a new agreement and of opportunities for MPs to block it.Downing Street has said it expected the cross-party alliance of rebels to precipitate the parliamentary battle on 9 September, a week after MPs return from their summer break, and did not foresee any move from the EU27 until after that.With the stage set for a historic clash between the executive and the legislature, a number of outcomes are possible. Johnson has a working majority of one and it is certainly feasible that enough Tory rebels would join opposition parties to ensure he loses a no-confidence motion. That would usher in a 14-day waiting period in which an alternative government could, in theory, be formed, but this would be unlikely to be headed by Jeremy Corbyn, who does not have sufficient cross-party support to enter No 10.There could, therefore, be some kind of “national unity” government, probably temporary, to delay Brexit until a new election or referendum – but the problem there is that it would need significant numbers of Labour and Tory MPs to break ranks, fast.Johnson might be able to force a no-deal Brexit by simply refusing to resign and letting the clock tick down, but the political pressure would be huge, and some have speculated that the Queen could be called on to, in effect, sack him.To thwart the opposition, Johnson could call a post-confidence vote election himself and decide on a polling day that falls after 31 October. That might contravene the convention of “purdah” (civil servants are not supposed to push through major policy changes during an election period), but no one is really sure.Finally, MPs could seizing control of the Commons order paper to try to delay Brexit or call a referendum. But this can only happen if there is meaningful government business on Brexit for MPs to amend, and with no deal seemingly the government’s intended course, there might not be any.For those with an interest in crystal-ball gazing, some wildly different scenarios are sketched here by assorted figures from the worlds of politics, arts and science.Britons have spent £4bn stockpiling goods in case of no-deal Brexit.Caroline Lucas calls for an emergency female cabinet to block no-deal Brexit.Lord Heseltine: imposing no-deal Brexit an “intolerable” attack on democracy.Is Scotland finally set to bid farewell to the union?Swinson’s Lib Dems target Raab’s seat as Tory moderates flee no-deal Brexit.Brexit enforcer Cummings’ farm took €235,000 in EU handouts.With Britain on the brink of recession, “doomsters” may be proved right.UK car industry in brace position before Brexit deadline.UK to ease visa restrictions on top scientists post-Brexit.Corbyn should tell Queen “We’re taking over” if Johnson loses confidence vote.House prices fall unexpectedly as pre-Brexit caution bites.US will be “on doorstep” ready to sign UK trade deal after Brexit, says Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state.Pause competition law to avoid food shortages, say manufacturers.No deal would harm UK security, senior officer warns.Rolls-Royce says it has spent £100m preparing for no-deal Brexit.UK too desperate to secure US trade deal, says Clinton’s treasury secretary.In the Observer, Andrew Rawnsley says Johnson’s plot to subvert democracy is more dangerous than Brexit itself, and Conservative MPs have to stop it:All possible solutions depend on there being sufficient Conservative MPs capable of remembering that Britain’s democratic fabric relies not so much on laws as assumptions that people will behave properly … If Britain crashes out of the EU in the middle of an election campaign deliberately delayed by a prime minister with no mandate, it won’t just be the constitution that will be plunged into the darkest crisis of our modern history.A former cabinet minister goes viral:Good to get away for a few days.

7902,"Media obsession with powerful advisers is not new. The influence of Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson was the stuff of hysteria in the Tony Blair years. Bernard Ingham and Marcia Williams were accused of having undue power during the eras of Margaret Thatcher and Harold Wilson. Right back to the original éminence grise in 17th century France, Père Joseph, and probably beyond, the mystique of the all-seeing adviser behind the throne has been a constant theme.But how well grounded is this in reality? What we do know is that those who work in the shadows are catnip to journalists who know less than they pretend about the workings of government. This is especially true in an embittered political era with a taste for conspiracy theories that seem to offer partisan observers simple explanations of complicated events. Sometimes the credulity can be abject.All of this has suddenly come together in Dominic Cummings, the new Downing Street prince of darkness, whose reputation for malign mastery has quickly vaulted to levels unmatched even by Campbell and Mandelson. Last week Cummings reportedly told his team that parliament could not oust Boris Johnson before the 31 October Brexit deadline even if he lost a vote of no confidence. On Wednesday Sir Malcolm Rifkind warned that Johnson could lose his head if he did a Charles I and defied the constitution in that way.When advisers become the story, as Cummings did this week, they should watch their backs as well as their heads. This sort of thing breeds resentment. Cummings already risks appearing – and being – the over-mighty subject of what is anyway a precarious and sectarian government. Something similar ended Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill’s tenure under Theresa May. Over the next few weeks the narrative of Cummings the magician will be tested to destruction. The destruction will either be ours or his, and possibly both.Dominic Cummings, the son of an oil rig project manager and a special needs teacher, was born in Durham in 1971. He attended a state primary school followed by the fee-paying Durham school and, in 1994, Oxford University, where he studied ancient and modern history. After three years living in Russia, where he attempted to set up an airline connecting Samara in the south with Vienna, the then 28-year-old became campaign director of Business for Sterling, which worked to prevent Britain from joining the euro.Although he has never, as far as anyone knows, been a member of a political party, Cummings was headhunted to be director of strategy for the then Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2002.While he was seen as a “young, thrusting moderniser”, Cummings quickly offended party traditionalists. He quit the job after only eight months, describing Duncan Smith as incompetent.Following the 2010 general election, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, appointed Cummings as his chief of staff. Many in Whitehall found Cummings as difficult as he found them. In 2013, civil servants in the Department for Education complained to the Independent of an “us-and-them, aggressive, intimidating culture” created by Cummings and Gove.He never hid his disdain for the workings of Whitehall and has derided Westminster figures in eye-catching media interviews and published rambling blogposts that are obsessed over by Westminster insiders. He described prime minister David Cameron as “a sphinx without a riddle”, and former Brexit minister David Davis as “thick as mince, lazy as a toad, and vain as Narcissus”.In 2015, Cummings and the political strategist Matthew Elliott founded Vote Leave, which was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official EU referendum leave campaign in April of the following year.Since the EU referendum, its tactics have been the subject of a series of high-profile scandals. Vote Leave’s use of data analytics has been scrutinised after the Observer reported that the data-mining company Cambridge Analytica had links to the Canadian digital firm AggregateIQ, on which Vote Leave spent 40% of its campaign budget.In July 2018, the Electoral Commission announced Vote Leave had been found guilty of breaking electoral law by overspending, following testimony from whistleblowers. The group was fined £61,000 and referred to the police. Cummings has used his blog to furiously defend himself and the Vote Leave campaign. In March 2019, he was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear at a committee of MPs investigating fake news.Frances PerraudinYet it would be as much of a mistake to dismiss Cummings as to exaggerate his mastery. He has certainly brought two weeks of focus to the Johnson government by making the Halloween deadline a non-negotiable centrepiece. He has changed the political conversation from Brexit or people’s vote to deal or no deal. Depending on events in the early autumn, he is clearly gearing up for a possible general election shortly afterwards.But Cummings does not control events. He is not Prospero, able to conjure up a tempest that delivers his enemies into his hands. He is having a good run, but he is helped by the most irresponsible parliamentary summer recess of modern times. Even now MPs should be aiming to get back to Westminster and hold the government to account before the planned return on 3 September. They should scrap this year’s party conferences too.Cummings is also only one player. The idea that he pulls all the strings is lazy and wrong. The Brexit outcome depends on a tangled web of interests and influences beyond his control. These include everything from the role of the Queen to the hoarding of toilet rolls. In particular, it depends on events in the real economy, in parliament, in the courts, in Northern Ireland, Scotland and the Irish Republic, in the EU and in Johnson’s own head.Those who take a Cummings-fixated view of the options find it is easier to forget this. They say the government’s aim is to crash out with no deal on 31 October and nothing will stand in the way. But that is not quite what Johnson and some of his ministers say. They say, still, that a deal is one possibility, perhaps a remote one, and that the UK government is even now looking for a deal with the EU in the next 12 weeks.This is often dismissed as a mere smokescreen because the deal Johnson wants is not on offer from the EU. But Johnson’s specific demand, though difficult for the EU to concede, is also very particular. He does not want to reopen every bit of the withdrawal agreement. He wants the Irish backstop removed from it. The EU says the backstop – a sensible guarantee that is supported on both sides of the Irish border – is a non-negotiable part of the withdrawal agreement. On the face of it, therefore, there is no possibility of a new deal.Yet step back from this confrontation a moment if you can. Listen to the talk about talks this week. In London, Downing Street says it wants to negotiate. In Brussels, the commission says it is open to “clarification”. In Dublin, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, says: “Our position is that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is closed but there is always room for talks and negotiations.” In Belfast, if the Sunday Times is right, the DUP – yes, the DUP – says it is prepared to consider a time-limited backstop.Think too about the economic and political pressures bearing in again on all the protagonists. In Britain the pound is sliding, the food industry is worrying and, according to the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, business faces an “instantaneous shock” and an early 2020 recession. But while Britain will suffer most from no deal – and heavily Tory and Brexit-supporting regions in England will suffer most of all – others will also suffer. A detailed survey in March by the Bertelsmann Foundation concluded that Ireland in particular will be very hard hit, as will northern France, Belgium and parts of the Netherlands.This is not to say that there will therefore be a rephrased deal to avert these and other bad consequences. Varadkar in particular is facing an election and has less room for manoeuvre as a result. Nor is it to say that the UK parliament can be relied on to find a way of stopping no deal or that the Tory party would fall into line in sufficient numbers if a deal were on offer.It is nevertheless possible that time-limiting the backstop in some way – five years is mentioned in some circles – and agreeing to negotiate the issues in the political declaration in good faith over an agreed timetable might, just might, make a difference. It would mean Britain leaving the EU. Johnson could claim a victory. But it could spare a lot of people, businesses, countries including Britain, and even Johnson himself, some real pain in the process. That deal might just be doable even now – whatever Cummings may say.• Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",Deal or no deal?

7953,"The stated intent of Boris Johnson’s government to ensure Brexit happens on 31 October, combined with a majority of MPs seemingly set on preventing a no-deal departure, sets the stage for a potential executive versus legislature struggle unparalleled in recent political history. How might such a constitutional crisis pan out?They can call one, and Labour has hinted strongly it will do so after the Commons returns in early September. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act of 2011, the opposition can table a motion saying: “This house has no confidence in HM government.” Last week’s Brecon and Radnorshire byelection reduced Johnson’s working majority to one, and it is perfectly feasible that a dozen or more Conservative MPs could join opposition parties to vote against him if the only other option were no deal.Unlike under the pre-2011 system, losing a vote of no confidence does not automatically herald a likely general election straight away. Instead, the law introduces a 14-day window in which the incumbent prime minister can try to prove they still command the support of the Commons, or else a new majority government can emerge. If neither happens, there is an election.Possibly, though there are many political barriers. It seems unlikely under Labour led by Jeremy Corbyn, as there does not seem to be sufficient cross-party support for him to enter No 10. One mooted possibility would be for some form of “national unity” government to take power, perhaps temporarily, to delay Brexit before an election or a new EU referendum, led by a consensual backbencher. However, this would need significant numbers of Labour and Tory MPs to break ranks and join MPs from other parties, all within a very brief window.The answer here is somewhere between “yes and no” and “who knows?” As several experts and observers have noted, the law does not make it explicit that a prime minister must resign if they lose a no-confidence vote, meaning Johnson could theoretically sit out the 14-day period before calling an election, by which point 31 October would be almost upon us.However, as others point out, the political pressure on him to go would be huge, and given an election would be imminent, effectively squatting in Downing Street to get your way would hardly be the best image for the electorate.Ultimately, prime ministers serve at the request of the monarch, and some have speculated that if a new, unity government was shown to be ready, and to command a Commons majority, the Queen could dismiss Johnson and invite a new prime minister to form a government. It is safe to say Buckingham Palace would very much not enjoy being put in such a position.Under the law, the date of the election following a no-confidence vote is a matter for the incumbent prime minister, and given the timetable – parliament returns from recess just over eight weeks before Brexit – Johnson could conceivably decide on a post-31 October polling day.Some no-deal objectors argue that under the convention of “purdah”, the election period during which civil servants are not supposed to push through any major policy changes, no major Brexit decisions could be taken. However, Johnson could argue that a no-deal departure on 31 October is already the legal default, and so is not a policy change.Either way, it would be hugely messy and no fun at all for senior civil servants, not least how to communicate no-deal preparations to the public amid purdah, when politically sensitive government messaging is meant to stop.In theory, yes – and this did happen in March, when MPs hijacked a government motion on the next steps for Brexit, passing an amendment tabled by the Tory grandee Oliver Letwin to hold indicative votes on a departure plan. It is possible that backbenchers could again circumvent the executive and order Johnson to seek a delay to Brexit, make arrangements for a referendum, or even – and this seems unlikely – revoke the whole process.However, this can only happen if there is meaningful government business on Brexit for MPs to amend, and with no deal seeming the government’s intended course, there might not be any. While there are a series of bills before parliament on post-Brexit arrangements for areas such as fisheries, agriculture and immigration, Downing Street has said it does not believe these need to be passed before 31 October. Another route could be artificially creating parliamentary time for, say, a private member’s bill, but again, this is not an easy process.",The fight over no-deal Brexit: how might the crisis pan out?,2019-08-06/15:23:50,the stated intent of boris johnson s government to ensure brexit happens on  october combined with a majority of mps seemingly set on preventing a no deal departure sets the stage for a potential executive versus legislature struggle unparalleled in recent political history how might such a constitutional crisis pan out they can call one and labour has hinted strongly it will do so after the commons returns in early september under the fixed term parliaments act of  the opposition can table a motion saying this house has no confidence in hm government last week s brecon and radnorshire byelection reduced johnson s working majority to one and it is perfectly feasible that a dozen or more conservative mps could join opposition parties to vote against him if the only other option were no deal unlike under the pre  system losing a vote of no confidence does not automatically herald a likely general election straight away instead the law introduces a  day window in which the incumbent prime minister can try to prove they still command the support of the commons or else a new majority government can emerge if neither happens there is an election possibly though there are many political barriers it seems unlikely under labour led by jeremy corbyn as there does not seem to be sufficient cross party support for him to enter no  one mooted possibility would be for some form of national unity government to take power perhaps temporarily to delay brexit before an election or a new eu referendum led by a consensual backbencher however this would need significant numbers of labour and tory mps to break ranks and join mps from other parties all within a very brief window the answer here is somewhere between yes and no and who knows as several experts and observers have noted the law does not make it explicit that a prime minister must resign if they lose a no confidence vote meaning johnson could theoretically sit out the  day period before calling an election by which point  october would be almost upon us however as others point out the political pressure on him to go would be huge and given an election would be imminent effectively squatting in downing street to get your way would hardly be the best image for the electorate ultimately prime ministers serve at the request of the monarch and some have speculated that if a new unity government was shown to be ready and to command a commons majority the queen could dismiss johnson and invite a new prime minister to form a government it is safe to say buckingham palace would very much not enjoy being put in such a position under the law the date of the election following a no confidence vote is a matter for the incumbent prime minister and given the timetable parliament returns from recess just over eight weeks before brexit johnson could conceivably decide on a post  october polling day some no deal objectors argue that under the convention of purdah the election period during which civil servants are not supposed to push through any major policy changes no major brexit decisions could be taken however johnson could argue that a no deal departure on  october is already the legal default and so is not a policy change either way it would be hugely messy and no fun at all for senior civil servants not least how to communicate no deal preparations to the public amid purdah when politically sensitive government messaging is meant to stop in theory yes and this did happen in march when mps hijacked a government motion on the next steps for brexit passing an amendment tabled by the tory grandee oliver letwin to hold indicative votes on a departure plan it is possible that backbenchers could again circumvent the executive and order johnson to seek a delay to brexit make arrangements for a referendum or even and this seems unlikely revoke the whole process however this can only happen if there is meaningful government business on brexit for mps to amend and with no deal seeming the government s intended course there might not be any while there are a series of bills before parliament on post brexit arrangements for areas such as fisheries agriculture and immigration downing street has said it does not believe these need to be passed before  october another route could be artificially creating parliamentary time for say a private member s bill but again this is not an easy process ,Brexit,0.23302550613880157
7972,"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can also catch our monthly Brexit Means … podcast here. And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.Boris Johnson held firm on his “do-or-die” promise to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October, clashing with the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and sending his special EU envoy to Brussels to deliver the message that the UK will leave without a deal unless the bloc abolishes the Irish backstop.In comments that suggest he is preparing to blame the EU if the UK crashes out, Johnson said he was not aiming for a no-deal Brexit but there could be no further meaningful talks without a radical EU rethink on the backstop and the situation was “very much up to our friends and partners across the Channel”.However, the weakness of the prime minister’s position was underlined when the Liberal Democrats won the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection, cutting his majority to one, and hardline Tory eurosceptic rebels said they would block any attempt to pass Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement again even if the backstop is removed.Johnson faces equally strong opposition from the left of his party, with moderate Tory supporters of a second referendum threatening to cross the House of Commons in order to foil Brexit – prompting urgent warnings that the new prime minister could rapidly lose control of parliament.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, did nothing to quell speculation about an autumn general election by announcing – in one of the most pro-Brexit areas of the country – that an “extra” £1.8bn would still be spent on NHS infrastructure and equipment even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Meanwhile, warnings of the consequences of leaving without a deal continued to come thick and fast: from Varadkar, who said we “should all be afraid” of it; the Bank of England, which said there was a one in three chance of a Brexit recession; and currency traders, who sent sterling to a new low.As evidence was published by the Lib Dems that companies that export only to the EU are largely unprepared for a no-deal Brexit, all English councils were instructed to appoint a “Brexit lead” to work with the government in preparing for the possibility that the UK will leave without an agreement.Brexit will take place on 31 October “whatever the circumstances”, No 10 insisted, refusing to say whether a parliamentary vote against no deal, a no-confidence vote in the prime minister or even a general election campaign would be considered sufficient reasons for it to change course.Brussels has certainly got the message: after the meeting between the prime minister’s chief envoy and senior EU figures, European diplomats were told Johnson has no intention whatsoever of renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and a no-deal Brexit is now his “central scenario”. It appears more and more likely that Johnson and his key adviser, Vote Leave mastermind Dominic Cummings, are indeed planning to take Britain out on 31 October regardless of what may happen in parliament – and perhaps in the middle of an election campaign.Many observers are now assuming No 10 is calculating that with Brexit delivered, the Tory party could unite the leave vote, obliterate Nigel Farage’s Brexit party altogether, and trounce the disheartened forces campaigning for a second referendum.Is that really the plan? Who knows. In the meantime, Jessica Elgot explains how the prime minister’s parliamentary majority could vanish, while Peter Walker and Seán Clarke examine the likely impact of a no-deal Brexit (spoiler: it’s not good).Surge in EU citizens unfairly refused access to universal credit.Low-income Britons ‘more vulnerable to recession than in 2008’.Edinburgh festival performers refuse sterling payments due to Brexit.UK less able to cope with hard Brexit than it was in spring, say officials.UK manufacturing ‘suffocating’ as output slips to seven-year low.BMW boss urges Boris Johnson to abandon no-deal Brexit.Labour would be ‘off our rockers’ not to back remain in poll, says Thornberry.We’ll block trade deal if Brexit imperils open Irish border, say US politicians.Brexit causes UK car industry investment to crash to ‘pitiful’ £90m.No-deal Brexit would endanger rural life, says Welsh leader.In the Guardian, Matthew d’Ancona works through how the next few months might pan out … It’s not pretty:When parliament returns on 3 September, the government will certainly face a vote of no confidence if it is still on course for a no-deal Brexit. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, a vote of no confidence in the government would trigger a two-week scramble to form a new administration. If that quest failed – as it would – an election would be triggered. The Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013 requires 25 working days between the dissolution of parliament and polling day. To squeeze in an election before Brexit day would require a vote of no confidence as soon as the Commons returned; the pre-emptive cancellation of the party conferences; a fortnight of pointless attempts to form an alternative government ending on, say, 17 September; and a snap election held after the minimum five-week campaign on Thursday, 24 October. Johnson wins, and Britain leaves a week later. How likely is it that this precise sequence will fall into place? How often does politics observe such neat patterns? It is more likely, indeed, that 31 October could fall in the middle of an election campaign – or even (since it is a Thursday) on polling day itself. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, believes there is no legal impediment to the UK leaving Europe even as rosette-bearing politicians crisscross the nation in battle buses. Already, the pro-remain campaigner Gina Miller is investigating the potential for a judicial review of this grotesque possibility. For how odd would it be for an election about Brexit, triggered by a confidence vote caused by Brexit, and framed by the prime minister’s readiness to embrace a no-deal Brexit, to be made both redundant and ridiculous in real time by Brexit happening anyway, in the thick of electoral battle? One might ask, more pithily: how the hell did we get here? Yet such are the times in which we live, and such are the worse ones towards which we are heading.Plunging pound - the Financial Times’ forex expert tells all:The Financial Times' @katie_martin_fx

8104,"In The Ultras, the brutal, brilliant novel by Eoin McNamee set during the Troubles, the protagonist (based on the real-life undercover British intelligence officer Robert Nairac) finds himself in the company of dangerous men like himself. The Ultras plot terrible events and create dark polities while forcing everyone else to live with their consequences. “Ultra meaning beyond,” wrote McNamee. “Ultra meaning extreme.”The so-called war cabinet formed by the new British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and whose course the maverick arch-Brexiteer Dominic Cummings now charts, of course bears no resemblance to the characters in the war of the Ultras imagined by McNamee. But the sheer velocity and ferocity of their opening salvoes about crashing out of the EU with no deal on October 31 unless the backstop – the insurance policy to avoid a hard border in Ireland – is abolished, raise the kind of alarm that we in Ireland have not felt since the dark years of the Troubles.The political fear is that this new breed of “Brexit Ultras” (Johnson’s cabinet with Nigel Farage’s Brexit party snapping at its heels) could deliberately pursue a no-deal EU exit at the expense of a volatile Irish peace.The sabre-rattling and pre-emptive blame-shifting of course is intended to shore up political support in the UK ahead of a possible general election, but also to intimidate Ireland into abandoning the backstop while shaking the unity of the EU27. Europe, with its own demons to face, has its red lines too and will not sacrifice the single market or its external borders, or jeopardise the wider integrity of the European project. Ireland, and the fragile peace process that has been built over the past 20 years, falls between these two positions.And while it is still early days for the Johnson premiership, we have a deteriorated state of Anglo-Irish relations following his ascent to power. How real is the damaging rhetoric emanating from London and the anti-Irish tropes spewing from much of the British media? David Yelland, the former editor of the Sun, revealed that he had been shocked when “Tories of influence” told him privately that Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s taoiseach “isn’t bright” and “the Irish will blink”. “It seems, amazingly, that this is the actual policy of HMG under Johnson,” tweeted Yelland. “They are anti-Irish, arrogant, dangerous and wrong.”That relations between London and Dublin are now strained is beyond dispute, though officials in Dublin insist that much of the noise is to be expected and aimed at a domestic UK audience rather than Ireland or the EU.Still, following his appointment, it took almost a week for Johnson to place a phone call with Varadkar, who leads a confidence-and-supply coalition that – while shaky on a series of domestic issues – serves as a national government in all but name for the purposes of Brexit. When the phone call did proceed, both men adopted an uncompromising stance: Johnson insisting the removal of the backstop is a precondition for any deal, Varadkar adamant that the EU will not relent on the withdrawal agreement.Varadkar rightly reminded Johnson of the British government’s obligation – as a co-signatory of the Good Friday agreement – to exercise its power in respect of Northern Ireland with rigorous impartiality. Johnson’s government relies, for the time being, on the support in the Commons of the Democratic Unionist party to prop up its narrow majority. The difficult parliamentary arithmetic, combined with Johnson’s inflammatory rhetoric, represents a serious challenge to the UK’s obligation to act as an honest broker in respect of Northern Ireland – the majority of whose citizens voted, like their Scottish brethren, to stay in the EU.And although unionists are being comforted, for now, by Johnson, their confidence that a hard Brexit will not give birth to a united Ireland must also be fraying at the seams. This is not least because nearly two-thirds of the Tory party indicate in polling that they would rather sacrifice the union – and see Northern Ireland and Scotland leave it – than abandon Brexit.Johnson (just like his predecessors) has yet to offer any meaningful alternatives to the backstop, yet blindly insists, as a pre-condition to talks with Brussels, that it must be removed. Given such a hardline starting point, what compromises would a deal with Brussels before October 31 entail? The recent ITV interview with the foreign secretary Dominic Raab on the issue of what flexibility the UK government has shown to date does not augur well for what lies ahead.The high-handed, perhaps not entirely unexpected tone of the hard Brexiteers, including Johnson, has undoubtedly reawakened bad memories in Ireland. Nobody on the island is blind to the reality that in standing by the backstop in order to avoid a hard border, they could end up with one if the UK crashes out without a deal. Indeed, the Irish government has conceded, in its latest updated contingency action plan, that it will implement increased checks and procedures in the event of a no-deal Brexit. That means border infrastructure and checkpoints that, however they are named and wherever they are, will have social and economic consequences both foreseen and unforeseen.One of those consequences is the possibility of a united Ireland – a prospect that terrifies me if the process of getting there is not given the time and breadth it needs, and if that existential, constitutional question it is not curated with the utmost inclusiveness and sensitivity.Last week Varadkar stated the obvious when he told the MacGill summer school that a hard Brexit would force communities in Northern Ireland to consider the possibility of a united Ireland. They already are. What was once an entirely fringe aspiration for nationalists, and a dreaded fear for unionists – each side comforted by the thought that the conversation about unification was decades away – has become an urgent debate for all.Contrary to anti-Irish tropes that the backstop is a Trojan horse in order to secure a united Ireland, the truth is that both communities in Northern Ireland – as well as citizens across the island of Ireland – are fearful of what a botched, rushed conversation about unification might yield. That fear is that the birth of a united Ireland would be accompanied by violence and upheaval.Unification without the support of unionists, whose traditions and identity must be protected as part of any shared future, cannot be pursued as a zero-sum game. Otherwise we risk repeating history: the Troubles in reverse. Northern Ireland could not, in its current perilous state, survive either a hard Brexit or a united Ireland. Its communities are suspended in an in-between space, in which they have enjoyed 21 years without violence but have not yet progressed to a positive peace or meaningful integration – a process that takes time and effort to heal wounds.What many people in the UK forget or are indifferent to is the fact that, for all the successes of the Good Friday agreement – a vital edifice that allows us to identify as British, Irish or both – peace is not fully won.That is why all the trash talk is so damaging, and why we need to pull back from the rhetorical brink. That is what is lost in this war of the Ultras: that the price of political power could be the unforgiveable loss of peace.• Dearbhail McDonald is an Irish commentator and the author of Bust",Irish

8159,"Labour’s Emily Thornberry has said the party would be “off our bloody rockers” not to seize the chance to remain in the EU via a second referendum, in an interview which put her at odds with comments from Jeremy Corbyn over the weekend.Speaking in Australia, the shadow foreign secretary said all her meetings in the country had underlined how much better off the UK would be inside the EU.“People that I’ve spoken to here appreciate that, and I have to say practically all of them … have said if we get an opportunity to remain in the European Union, we should take it. Because if we don’t, we’re off our bloody rockers,” she said.On Sunday Corbyn said Labour would campaign for a second referendum and to remain in the EU if Johnson was proposing a no-deal Brexit but said the party would “reopen talks with the EU” about a Brexit deal if it won an election.Asked personally whether he would prefer to remain in the EU or to leave with a Labour-backed deal, Corbyn declined to make a choice. “Investment, jobs, trade and equality, both in or out of the EU. I want those things,” he said.“What we proposed was actually a very credible deal. A bespoke customs union with the EU and the trade arrangements would have achieved those things. It didn’t go through parliament, that was the problem.”Speaking to Sky News Australia’s Graham Richardson, Thornberry said a second referendum should apply to “any deal, or no deal, or whatever this government comes up with”.She added: “It should be put back to the British people so they can be asked: is this what you voted for?

8193,"Boris Johnson has declined to give specific details about how his government would help agriculture in the event of a no-deal Brexit, after farming groups said it would be catastrophic for the sheep and lamb industry.Before a trip to Wales on Tuesday, where he visited a chicken farm near Newport, the prime minister was urged to “stop playing Russian roulette” with farming and warned that leaving the EU without a deal could spark civil unrest.But Johnson dismissed those concerns, saying it was important for people to be confident about the government’s no-deal plans.During his farm visit, he declined twice to provide details on what sort of help farmers would get, beyond saying they had the support they needed and that the government would help them to find new markets if other ones became trickier to do business with. “We have interventions that are aimed to support them and their incomes,” he added.Johnson said: “As you know, Defra, the [agriculture] ministry, has done a huge amount already to prepare in advance to 29 March, and will do even more to prepare in the run-up to 31 October, when we come out.”Pressed on what help would be provided, he said: “The more you prepare, and the more confident you are about the measures you put in place, the less likely it is that there will be difficulties when it comes to 31 October.”Johnson reiterated his belief that a no-deal outcome was unlikely, and said it was up to the EU whether the UK left the bloc without a new withdrawal agreement: “It’s their call if they want us to do this.”He said the EU had to accept the removal of the Irish backstop – something Brussels has repeatedly said it would not do.“If they understand that then I think we’re going to be at the races,” said Johnson. “If they can’t compromise, if they really can’t do it, then clearly we have to get ready for a no-deal exit, and I think we’ll do it. I think the people of this country are full of resolve and purpose, and we will look after the farming sector.”On his visit to Wales, Johnson met Mark Drakeford, the Labour first minister. A Welsh government spokesperson said the pair “had substantial discussions, but clearly there are fundamentally different views on Brexit”.Drakeford “repeatedly warned of the catastrophic impact Brexit would have on Wales and pressed the prime minister on what support would be available for Welsh industry and agricultural sectors” but “no details [were] given about new or alternative markets”.The first minister also urged Johnson to hold a second referendum “to test the views of the people”. Before the trip, Johnson was warned that 40% tariffs on meat exported to the EU could lead to the mass slaughter of sheep.The first task of any new PM involves rewarding some loyal allies and disappointing more. Several Johnson loyalists have had their eye on the post of chancellor, but only one can do it. A complete clearout of May’s remain-minded ministers provided plenty of opportunity to reward the Brexit believers though.The issue that will define a Johnson premiership. He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May’s departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy – something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break. If this fails, he will be set on a no-deal departure for 31 October, and a likely huge clash with MPs.  If Brexit wasn’t enough, a new Johnson government must immediately take steps to make sure he doesn’t begin his time in No 10 with a slide into war. The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn’t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the ‘Gaukward squad’ of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks.Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters – especially Tory members – will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider – during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May’s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care; the future of the NHS; a climate emergency; the increasingly insecure future of work; a broken housing market; rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.Critics might say this is Johnson’s single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor – an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers – Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary.Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 – a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness. Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle - his adopting the acronym 'Dude' in his victory speech shows just how hard it is for him. Peter Walker Political correspondentHelen Roberts from the National Sheep Association in Wales said it would be “absolutely catastrophic” to leave with no deal and could lead to civil unrest among sheep farmers.“I’d want him to stop playing Russian roulette with the industry,” she said.Roberts said she did not want to see a mass slaughter for welfare reasons and that the government needed to get cold storage in place and talk about public procurement of lamb meat.Asked about civil unrest among farmers such as tractors being used to block roads, she said: “I think they will. It is time to stand up for ourselves ... I suspect there will be protests.”Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers Union, said there would be no market for 40% of the UK’s lamb meat in the event of a no-deal Brexit.“You would be in oversupply because you wouldn’t be able to get over the barrier of a tariff to Europe,” she said.She said a mass slaughter was the last thing the NFU wanted but to avoid that the government would need to look at forcing hospitals, schools and other public bodies to buy lamb meat.Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, agreed that farming was a winner from having access to EU markets but said there was potential for exports to new markets.Asked for his response to threats of civil unrest, he claimed UK farmers could export their meat to Japan rather than Europe.“I would say we are working to get a deal and the European market is important to us but there are markets around the world,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.He added that it was not clear how civil unrest would take place. “The context is that Wales has voted to leave the EU … we have an obligation to leave and of course we would much prefer to leave with a deal.”Last week research commissioned by the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board and Quality Meat Scotland found that combined beef and sheep meat exports to the EU could decline by 92.5%, with the lamb export trade “almost completely wiped out”.In a no-deal scenario, the 37,000 carcasses a week that are usually sent to Europe would be stopped overnight under strict EU import rules that require de facto licensing for all farm exports.This has led to suggestions of a mass cull of animals as well as the need for state aid to support farmers, some of whom earn as little as £13,000 a year.",Johnson refuses to give details on

8198,"No-deal Brexit, crashing out, or a departure on WTO terms – call it what you will, it seems increasingly possible the UK could experience this on 31 October. How could it end up happening? And what would it mean?No deal is the default – without a withdrawal agreement in place it takes place automatically on 31 October. A new deal seems increasingly unlikely given that Boris Johnson and his ministers have demanded terms – scrapping the Irish backstop and an entirely new withdrawal deal – that have been repeatedly rejected by Brussels and would be hugely ambitious anyway given the 93-day deadline.It seems a majority of MPs still oppose a no-deal departure, as they did in March. It nonetheless remains unknown if the Commons can block Johnson if he is intent on such a Brexit, whether or not proroguing parliament is possible. MPs would need to create the circumstances for a binding vote and it is unclear how this might be done. It is worth noting here that some in Westminster see a government intent on no deal being blocked by parliament as Johnson’s preferred scenario – allowing him to call an election as the self-styled champion of Brexit.The first task of any new PM involves rewarding some loyal allies and disappointing more. Several Johnson loyalists have had their eye on the post of chancellor, but only one can do it. A complete clearout of May’s remain-minded ministers provided plenty of opportunity to reward the Brexit believers though.The issue that will define a Johnson premiership.

Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle - his adopting the acronym 'Dude' in his victory speech shows just how hard it is for him. Peter Walker Political correspondentIt would simply mean that at 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no post-Brexit plan in place, and no transition period. This would drop the UK out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.To a great extent this is a leap in the dark, given the multiplicity of factors involved, but a number of sectors are deeply worried. With meat farming, there would be an immediate WTO 40% tariff on exports to the EU, which could instantly wipe out many farming businesses. Other UK firms that export to the EU would need to apply for customs, excise and VAT procedures, or they could not ship goods. Delays due to border checks, which many business groups warn could soon become very long, would have knock-on effects for firms reliant on a constant stream of supplies. For individuals, there are concerns about supplies of medicines, and the potential that travellers to the EU might need to go through extra checks. Essentially, for both businesses and individuals, the potential list of impact is very long and cannot be completely predicted.The government began preparing for possible no deal ahead of the original Brexit deadline in March, passing legislation to cover areas such as nuclear material, money laundering and road haulage, and moving thousands of civil servants to make no-deal plans. While some warn that the government is still less prepared for an October no deal, planning has been stepped up under Johnson, with Michael Gove handed a cross-government cabinet role to lead on this, complete with a select cabinet sub-committee. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has promised extra funds in the event of no deal and could put together an autumn budget intended to rejuvenate the economy. The government is also reportedly spending up to £100m on an advertising campaign to let businesses and people know how to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.It would involve checks of some form, whatever the UK government’s insistence that it will not impose any infrastructure. As the Irish government has pointed out repeatedly, Ireland cannot remain a part of the EU’s single market and allow the unmonitored flow of goods across what will then become a customs, standards and regulation border. While there is an understandable desire to avoid infrastructure on the frontier – which has so many crossing points it is virtually impossible to completely police anyway – some new system of checks would come into place.This is a question which the Johnson government has, as yet, not answered, particularly in the context of the many tax cuts and spending plans so far unveiled. Much of this has been based on the idea of using some or all of the £26bn or so of “fiscal headroom” – extra borrowing that would be permitted within current limits – to pay for this. However, Treasury forecasts say this money would evaporate in the economic hit of no deal. On the campaign trail Johnson said the government could instead use the £39bn divorce settlement with the EU. However, this is not a credible plan, as the sum covers a series of already-agreed UK commitments paid over a number of years. Some of the money could not be clawed back, and to renege on other payments would severely damage the UK’s financial credibility.No. One of the biggest appeals about a no-deal Brexit for voters who support it is the idea of “getting it over with”, absorbing whatever chaos takes place and moving on to other priorities. But this is a fantasy. The UK could not trade perpetually on WTO terms and would need to make a permanent trade deal with the EU – involving just the same issues as before, such as a divorce payment, and arrangements for the Irish border. The main difference is that this would all need to happen as quickly as possible, without the buffer of a transition period running to the end of 2020.",No-deal Brexit: how likely is it and what would

8216,"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can catch our monthly Brexit Means … podcast here. And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.Boris Johnson became Britain’s new prime minister and immediately promised to negotiate a better departure agreement with the EU – while ramping up preparations for a no deal and delivering Brexit come what may on 31 October.Johnson packed his cabinet with loyal leavers and rightwing free marketeers headed by Sajid Javid at the Treasury and Priti Patel and Dominic Raab at the Home and Foreign Offices, and made Vote Leave mastermind Dominic Cummings a key adviser.In the Commons, the new prime minister pledged again to ditch the “undemocratic” Irish backstop and guarantee the rights of EU nationals in the UK, promising that post-Brexit the UK would have “the greatest and most prosperous economy in Europe” by 2050.The EU was quick to reject the UK’s new conditions: Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, said UK proposals must be compatible with the withdrawal agreement, while the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, described Johnson’s demand to remove the backstop as unacceptable.France and Ireland expressed alarm. Amélie de Montchalin, France’s European affairs secretary, repeated that the current withdrawal agreement was the the only way for the UK to leave the EU “in an orderly fashion”, and Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said Johnson was setting the UK “on a collision course with the EU”.But the prime minister doubled down, insisting no face-to-face talks with the EU were planned and there would be none until leaders agreed to drop the backstop, which he described in a phone call on Friday with Angela Merkel as “the only solution”.Michael Gove made clear the government was now “operating on an assumption” of no deal and several other ministers said Johnson was “turbo-charging” preparations to leave the EU without a deal if the EU refuses to drop the backstop.Dominic Raab said it would be the fault of a “stubborn” EU if the UK were to crash out without a deal and suggested – contrary to the view of most experts – that Britain would actually be better placed to negotiate a “good deal” afterwards.It won’t be plain sailing. The Institute for Government warned that the mammoth scale of the economic and bureaucratic emergency that would follow a no-deal Brexit would crush Johnson’s ambitious domestic agenda.And Johnson may not even get that far: the former Tory chancellor, Philip Hammond, confirmed he had held private talks with Labour’s Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, to plot cross-party moves aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit.The burning Brexit question is now this: government ministers may be talking tough, but do they really mean it – or is it all a lot of noise aimed at shoring up Conservative support for an imminent general election?Many observers think Johnson’s plan is to go to the country after demanding first what he knows Brussels cannot give (a backstop-free withdrawal agreement) and, second, what he knows parliament will not countenance (a no-deal Brexit).The prime minister, this theory runs, will then be able to portray himself, faced with the intransigence of a bullying EU and the cowardice of a remainer parliament, as the only true deliverer of Brexit and champion of “the will of the people”.We have no means of knowing, obviously, whether this is the case. But political scientist Rob Ford has an good piece here on the risks and opportunities for Johnson of trying to change the arithmetic in the Commons by means of an early election.Of course, Johnson could actually be serious about being willing, as Raab said, to “give the country some finality” by taking it out of the EU without a deal – with the dramatic consequences almost all experts believe that would entail.Pound drops to lowest level in two years amid no-deal Brexit rhetoricUK employment rate resilient despite Brexit uncertaintyBrexit could spell end of Ellesmere Port plant, says Vauxhall ownerUK aerospace industry steps up no-deal Brexit plan to switch regulatorI won’t support no-deal Brexit, says defiant Ruth DavidsonSacked minister urges Boris Johnson to dial down Brexit rhetoricNo plans for new laws to safeguard rights of EU citizens, says No 10We have been forgotten by Boris Johnson, say Britons in EuropeIn the Guardian, Matthew d’Ancona says the Vote Leave gang now running Britain do not want to govern but to win:Vote Leave was a campaign, not a party. Its business was direct democracy, not the representative variety. No wonder that some senior ministers are so excited to discover that – technically, at least – the UK could still leave the EU on 31 October, even if the country were then in the thick of an election campaign forced by a vote of no confidence. This is where a country ends up when it is governed by a caucus with a single, overriding objective. Johnson’s strategy, for all its initial brio and swagger, leads nowhere other than a zone of anger, division and dangerous disillusionment. To which his allies would doubtless say: so what? You heard the man – by any means necessary.And John Harris says Johnson is channelling a punk ethos to force through Brexit, and it could work:Punk spirit, cavalier style and wilful provocation will all inform the manner in which Johnson and his allies frame their greatest challenge of all: how on earth to deal with the very real crisis of Brexit and honour the Halloween deadline. And they look set to play a crucial role in gaining consent from those who have most to lose from crashing out of the EU. Faced with a set of impossible challenges, Johnson will present himself as the flamboyant, verbose, rule-breaking Englishman versus the washed-out logicians of the EU machine. Whether this approach could survive the sudden appearance of expensive food, empty shelves and queues of lorries is an interesting question. But in the midst of all that talk about a quickfire election and given deep-rooted English cultural traits and the strange, hallucinatory times in which we live, I would not underestimate his appeal.An eminent historian speaks:this is an INVENTED crisis; none of this has to happen - and woe betide those who are needlessly inflicting it https://t.co/IFYpxHBJtH",Brexit weekly briefing: Boris

8227,"The pound has slumped to a 28-month low as investors reacted with alarm to the escalation of no-deal rhetoric by Boris Johnson’s government.Sterling dropped below $1.23 against the US dollar and fell sharply against the euro to below €1.10 on the international currency markets on Monday, as cabinet ministers began meetings to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.But while the pound suffered, there was confusion from Johnson’s government about whether a no-deal Brexit is the main working assumption. The prime minister himself insisted there was an “assumption that we can get a new deal” and that he wanted to reach out to European leaders.However, his deputy official spokeswoman reinforced the position of Michael Gove, the cabinet lead for no-deal preparations, that “we must assume that there will be a no-deal Brexit on 31 October” unless EU leaders agree to reopen talks on the withdrawal agreement. The spokeswoman also made clear Johnson would not be meeting EU leaders until they agree to make a new deal that does not involve the Irish backstop.As the pound lurched downwards on Monday, an array of leading business groups lined up to voice exasperation that a lack of information from the government was hampering preparations for no deal.Echoing a warning from the Confederation of British Industry at the weekend Britain is ill-equipped for a disorderly EU departure, lobby groups representing firms employing millions of people across the UK sounded the alarm.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said the lack of preparedness among its members was “frightening”, while the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said industry’s questions about how to prepare had “gone unanswered”. The Institute of Directors (IoD) said guidance from government had been partial and was yet to be properly road tested.The pound fell by more than 1.3% against the US currency to trade at about $1.2216, its lowest point since March 2017, extending a slide under way over recent months as the chance of the UK crashing out of the EU at the end of October mounts. The pound was down by a similar amount against the single currency at €1.0965.Analysts said comments from senior figures in Johnson’s cabinet had rocked the City, including a suggestion from Dominic Raab on Monday morning that the UK would be in a better place to negotiate a good deal with the EU after no-deal Brexit.The foreign secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the EU’s “stubborn” behaviour would be responsible if the UK left without an agreement with Brussels at the end of October.Petr Krpata of the City bank ING said: “The market [is] awaking to the reality of a new UK government, its rather combative stance on the current EU-UK Brexit deal, and its open remarks on the rising probability of a no-deal Brexit.”Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at financial trading platform IG, said: “With two months until the October deadline, there is reason to believe that the pound has plenty more downside to come.”Over the weekend, several key figures in Johnson’s government said the prime minister was “turbo-charging” preparations for no deal. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is expected to ramp up spending on no-deal readiness by about £1bn this week and the government is preparing to spend around £100m on a public information campaign for citizens and businesses using broadcast media and billboards.Hitting holidaymakers in the pocket as they head abroad during the school holidays, the pound has sunk by more than 10 cents against the dollar from a peak in excess of $1.33 in March. Against the euro it has fallen by more than 7 cents from a high of €1.17 recorded in May.The BCC, which represents 75,000 businesses employing 6 million people, called on the government to up the ante on no-deal preparations.“The 31 October deadline is fast approaching and businesses are being told to prepare for no deal, but there are still significant areas where there is simply little basis on which to plan,” said Claire Walker, co-executive director of the BCC.“Business communities want the government to make every effort to avoid no deal, but at the same time, urgently need it to up the ante on its planning to enable firms to prepare for all scenarios.”The FSB urged the government to “put its money where its mouth is” by handing £3,000 “Brexit vouchers” to small firms that trade overseas, to help them pay for advice on navigating custom and tariffs.Edwin Morgan, interim director general of the IoD, also called for firms to be issued with Brexit vouchers and criticised the lack of detail from government.“We have long urged our members to make any preparations they can for no deal, but many smaller firms simply haven’t had the time or money to spend on getting ready for something that has not been, and still isn’t, government policy,” he said.Make UK, the trade body for manufacturers, said many firms had already spent money preparing for the original Brexit date in March and might struggle to raise more cash.“Warehousing costs have increased enormously and October is a time when capacity is already pre-booked by retailers for Christmas,” said Ben Fletcher, executive director of communications, government and policy.“It’s going to be more expensive for businesses that struggled to prepare in the spring.”",Pound drops to lowest level in two years amid

8292,"Four days after becoming prime minister, Boris Johnson has yet to make a phone call to his Irish counterpart. Leo Varadkar appears to have been pushed back in the queue with no arrangements yet in place for the conventional call that takes place when new leaders assume office in Ireland and the UK.Johnson has already spoken to five leaders around the world including Donald Trump on Friday, who later revealed he talked about doing a trade deal “five times” the size of existing arrangements with the UK.Also on Friday, Johnson contacted the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to discuss a Brexit transition and in his first two days of office he spoke to Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Jean-Claude Juncker.The lack of contact with the taoiseach will add to the existing strains in Anglo-Irish relations since Johnson assumed power, with new tensions over remarks on the risks to Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.Varadkar said on Friday evening that “more and more people in Northern Ireland will come to question the union” if the UK crashed out of the EU, putting the region, which voted to remain, into a new historical chapter with the rest of the island of Ireland.“People who you might describe as moderate nationalists, or moderate Catholics, who are more or less happy with the status quo, will look towards a united Ireland. And I think increasingly you see liberal Protestants and unionists who will start to ask where they feel more at home,” he said at a summer school in Donegal.“One of the things that ironically could really undermine the union of the UK is a hard Brexit, both for Northern Ireland and for Scotland, and that is a problem they are going to have to face.”Congratulations to @borisjohnson on his election as party leader. Look forward to an early engagement on #Brexit, Northern Ireland and bilateral relationsHis remarks earned a sharp rebuke from the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley Jr who said his intervention was “unhelpful and unnecessarily aggressive”.DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said the “hysterical and self-centred” response of the Irish government to the demands of the UK prime minister to have the backstop removed from any exit deal speaks volumes.“The megaphone reaction demonstrates that the blatant attempts by Leo Varadkar and co to use the Irish border as a means of undermining Britain’s referendum has backfired on them and they know it.“The Irish government walked the world stage and styled themselves as the victims of British aggression. ‘Poor little Ireland’ may have worked in the past but people are growing tired of the same old tune. The game is up.“They have overplayed their hand and they need to change course.”Varadkar also said he would need to meet Johnson to understand his “real red lines” on Brexit, and that Ireland had shown in the past that it could be flexible.Johnson has already spoken to other leaders in the UK including Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, and Michelle O’Neill, the head of Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland.On Friday Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, described Johnson’s comments on Brexit as “unhelpful” and said he appeared to be putting the UK on a “collision course” with the EU.He made his remarks after what he described as a “useful” meeting with Julian Smith, the new Northern Ireland secretary, who went to Belfast for a series of meetings aimed at getting the Stormont assembly up and running again.Downing Street has been approached for comment.",Boris Johnson yet to make a phone call to Irish PM Leo Varadkar,2019-07-27/13:43:15,four days after becoming prime minister boris johnson has yet to make a phone call to his irish counterpart leo varadkar appears to have been pushed back in the queue with no arrangements yet in place for the conventional call that takes place when new leaders assume office in ireland and the uk johnson has already spoken to five leaders around the world including donald trump on friday who later revealed he talked about doing a trade deal five times the size of existing arrangements with the uk also on friday johnson contacted the canadian prime minister justin trudeau to discuss a brexit transition and in his first two days of office he spoke to angela merkel emmanuel macron and jean claude juncker the lack of contact with the taoiseach will add to the existing strains in anglo irish relations since johnson assumed power with new tensions over remarks on the risks to northern ireland s place in the united kingdom varadkar said on friday evening that more and more people in northern ireland will come to question the union if the uk crashed out of the eu putting the region which voted to remain into a new historical chapter with the rest of the island of ireland people who you might describe as moderate nationalists or moderate catholics who are more or less happy with the status quo will look towards a united ireland and i think increasingly you see liberal protestants and unionists who will start to ask where they feel more at home he said at a summer school in donegal one of the things that ironically could really undermine the union of the uk is a hard brexit both for northern ireland and for scotland and that is a problem they are going to have to face congratulations to borisjohnson on his election as party leader look forward to an early engagement on brexit northern ireland and bilateral relationshis remarks earned a sharp rebuke from the democratic unionist party dup mp ian paisley jr who said his intervention was unhelpful and unnecessarily aggressive dup brexit spokesman sammy wilson said the hysterical and self centred response of the irish government to the demands of the uk prime minister to have the backstop removed from any exit deal speaks volumes the megaphone reaction demonstrates that the blatant attempts by leo varadkar and co to use the irish border as a means of undermining britain s referendum has backfired on them and they know it the irish government walked the world stage and styled themselves as the victims of british aggression poor little ireland may have worked in the past but people are growing tired of the same old tune the game is up they have overplayed their hand and they need to change course varadkar also said he would need to meet johnson to understand his real red lines on brexit and that ireland had shown in the past that it could be flexible johnson has already spoken to other leaders in the uk including scotland s first minister nicola sturgeon the dup leader arlene foster and michelle o neill the head of sinn féin in northern ireland on friday ireland s deputy prime minister simon coveney described johnson s comments on brexit as unhelpful and said he appeared to be putting the uk on a collision course with the eu he made his remarks after what he described as a useful meeting with julian smith the new northern ireland secretary who went to belfast for a series of meetings aimed at getting the stormont assembly up and running again downing street has been approached for comment ,Brexit,0.2572755217552185
8348,"The Irish government has expressed alarm at Boris Johnson’s approach to Brexit as tension begins to mount over the increased risk of no deal.Michael Creed, Ireland’s agriculture minister, said the new position of the British government, which involves demands for a new deal without the Irish border backstop within 98 days, was a concern.“The makeup of this government seems to be a mirror image of his [Johnson’s] own viewpoint substantially and obviously that would be of concern to us,” he told RTÉ radio.“What the government is concerned about now is the approach of new administration in the UK to the withdrawal agreement. We see that as the way to have a planned withdrawal arrangement and obviously what we are hearing from the government is quite alarming.”On Wednesday the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said a “whole new” Brexit deal was “not going to happen”.No details have yet emerged of Johnson’s alternative proposals for the Irish border but he distanced himself from speculation about a return to a Northern Ireland-only backstop, telling the House of Commons that no part of the UK would remain in the customs union or single market.At the same time he referred to “abundant facilitations already available” away from the border for checks that could seal a deal. This could be read as an attempt to cherry-pick elements of the backstop arrangements, which include proposals for limited checks in warehouses, on farms and at ports and airports to ensure the single market was protected.Officials and politicians on both sides of the border welcomed the appointment of the former chief whip Julian Smith as Northern Ireland secretary. Smith is expected to fly to Belfast on Friday for his first series of meetings. His in-tray includes keeping the DUP onside for Brexit, getting devolved government restored and ensuring the region’s businesses, police and communities are ready for no deal.It is understood the Democratic Unionist party is happy that a “heavyweight” and a man it is familiar with will be in charge after Karen Bradley, who survived several calls to resign over various gaffes during her tenure.Nigel Dodds, the head of the DUP in the Commons, called on Johnson to “strain every sinew to strengthen the union, get a deal to leave on the right terms and get Stormont up and running again”.The DUP’s arrangement with the Tories holds for the duration of the government but must be reviewed before every Queen’s speech, which has been delayed by the Tory leadership battle. The party is expected to stress the urgent need to get government going again in Northern Ireland.Last week analysis from Stormont’s department for the economy said a no-deal Brexit could put 40,000 jobs at risk in Northern Ireland.The Freight Transport Association (FTA) and other business interests including Retail Consortium of Northern Ireland will be seeking early meetings with Smith’s team to drive home the realities of the all-island economy.Seamus Leheny, head of the FTA in Northern Ireland, said: “We have members who cross the border to distributions centres outside Dublin with 45-minute windows. If there are any delays at the border and they lose the slot they go to back of the queue. We are not against Brexit or optimism. What we are interested in is the facts.”",Irish minister says Boris Johnson's Brexit stance 'quite alarming',2019-07-25/16:30:36,the irish government has expressed alarm at boris johnson s approach to brexit as tension begins to mount over the increased risk of no deal michael creed ireland s agriculture minister said the new position of the british government which involves demands for a new deal without the irish border backstop within  days was a concern the makeup of this government seems to be a mirror image of his johnson s own viewpoint substantially and obviously that would be of concern to us he told rté radio what the government is concerned about now is the approach of new administration in the uk to the withdrawal agreement we see that as the way to have a planned withdrawal arrangement and obviously what we are hearing from the government is quite alarming on wednesday the irish taoiseach leo varadkar said a whole new brexit deal was not going to happen no details have yet emerged of johnson s alternative proposals for the irish border but he distanced himself from speculation about a return to a northern ireland only backstop telling the house of commons that no part of the uk would remain in the customs union or single market at the same time he referred to abundant facilitations already available away from the border for checks that could seal a deal this could be read as an attempt to cherry pick elements of the backstop arrangements which include proposals for limited checks in warehouses on farms and at ports and airports to ensure the single market was protected officials and politicians on both sides of the border welcomed the appointment of the former chief whip julian smith as northern ireland secretary smith is expected to fly to belfast on friday for his first series of meetings his in tray includes keeping the dup onside for brexit getting devolved government restored and ensuring the region s businesses police and communities are ready for no deal it is understood the democratic unionist party is happy that a heavyweight and a man it is familiar with will be in charge after karen bradley who survived several calls to resign over various gaffes during her tenure nigel dodds the head of the dup in the commons called on johnson to strain every sinew to strengthen the union get a deal to leave on the right terms and get stormont up and running again the dup s arrangement with the tories holds for the duration of the government but must be reviewed before every queen s speech which has been delayed by the tory leadership battle the party is expected to stress the urgent need to get government going again in northern ireland last week analysis from stormont s department for the economy said a no deal brexit could put   jobs at risk in northern ireland the freight transport association fta and other business interests including retail consortium of northern ireland will be seeking early meetings with smith s team to drive home the realities of the all island economy seamus leheny head of the fta in northern ireland said we have members who cross the border to distributions centres outside dublin with  minute windows if there are any delays at the border and they lose the slot they go to back of the queue we are not against brexit or optimism what we are interested in is the facts ,Brexit,0.2604644000530243

And for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.Both the Lords and the Commons gave Boris Johnson, who has pledged to negotiate wholesale changes to the withdrawal agreement or leave the EU “deal or no deal” by 31 October (and refused to rule out proroguing parliament to do so), a stark reminder of the challenge his premiership will face.After the upper house voted to ensure parliament must sit in the weeks leading up to the Brexit deadline, MPs – including Conservative rebels – followed suit, blocking any attempt to suspend parliament in order to force through a no-deal Brexit.The presumed prime minister’s march into Downing Street on Wednesday has also been spoiled by a string of ministerial resignations, with Philip Hammond and David Gauke saying they would step down before then, and Alan Duncan quitting on Monday in an unsuccessful bid to test parliament’s confidence in Johnson.Dominic Grieve warned that former ministers would join those prepared to vote down a Johnson administration heading for no deal and Labour’s Keir Starmer is seeking a cross-party alliance to block any attempt to leave without an agreement.However, Labour is thought unlikely to table a no-confidence motion in the new prime minister immediately, mainly because it stands little chance of winning before Johnson has at least tried to renegotiate Theresa May’s deal with Brussels.The new prime minister is therefore likely just to make a statement setting out his summer Brexit plans – at which point parliament breaks until September. “We’ll give him a time-limited chance,” one minister said.Assorted senior figures including three former prime ministers, meanwhile, poured scorn on Johnson’s embrace of a no-deal Brexit and his insistence, in his Telegraph column, that Brexit was like landing on the moon – all that was needed to pull it off was a bit of “can-do spirit” and a “sense of mission”.As the Democratic Unionist party impressed on him the need to resolve the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop to keep its support, Johnson claimed – giving no evidence as to how – that technological solutions could be found to prevent a hard border in Ireland.To add to Johnson’s concerns, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned that a no-deal Brexit would plunge Britain into a recession that would shrink the economy by 2% and push unemployment above 5%.Amid reports in the British press of all sorts of possible concessions being lined up by the EU27, including a “no-deal Brexit extension” beyond 31 October, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, insisted a new British prime minister would not change the fundamentals and there was no chance of the EU ditching or watering down the Irish backstop.The EU said it had no off-the-shelf Brexit plan for the new prime minister, was not working on one and there was now a “worrying lack of time” to find a compromise. It would put nothing new on the table but remained open to reworking the political declaration on future relations, sources said.Bronwen Maddox of the Institute for Government said Johnson faced four major and critical tasks in his first week: pick his cabinet, replace the chief negotiator, Olly Robbins, restart no-deal preparations and devise a plan for winning parliamentary support.Jo Swinson elected new Lib Dem leader, pledges to fight BrexitAnti-Brexit protesters take to London streets.Weary firms gear up to hit the Brexit pause button for a second time.Prices rise for British tourists as Brexit puts the pound in the shade.Pro-Brexit activist wins appeal against £20,000 electoral spending fine.Revenue chief who received death threats over Brexit steps down.Ursula von der Leyen: hard Brexit would be massive blow for both sides.£1.3m in bonuses paid to Brexit department civil servants.Pound could fall to parity with dollar on hard-Brexit concerns.Hammond “terrified” by Jacob Rees-Mogg claim of no-deal Brexit boost.London house prices fall at fastest rate in 10 years.Sharp rise in Britons making applications for Irish passports.Jonathan Freedland wonders in the Guardian whether a no-deal Brexit might not have a silver lining – but suspects not:Perhaps no deal is what it will take to cure the country of its Brexit fever. Maybe nothing less than a complete severance of all ties is the only way to snap ourselves out of this delirium. Until now, for example, the Brexiters have been able to cast every hitch and disappointment as the handiwork of wicked remainers bent on thwarting Britain’s destiny. If there’s been no stampede of unicorns towards the sunlit uplands, that’s because the faint-hearts and fifth columnists connived with Brussels to deny the British people their will. A no-deal exit would end that betrayal myth once and for all. Nigel Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg and the others would have got everything they wanted. They would be unable to cry treachery, because we would have left the EU the way they demanded we leave. They’d be unable to blame remainers or the judges or the BBC or the universities, because no one would have stood in their way. It will be their Brexit and they will have to own it … But how plausible is it to imagine that, even if Brexit is the total rupture Farage yearns for, he won’t still insist that the people were betrayed and that this Brexit was insufficiently pure? And expectations of a no-deal exit are so low, if Britons are not living in the streets wearing animal skins and foraging for weevils by Christmas, the Brexiters will declare it a triumph.Nothing is certain, as we well know.

8508,"A change in British prime minister will not shift the fundamental realities of Brexit, Ireland’s deputy PM has warned, saying there is no chance of the EU ditching or watering down the Irish backstop.Wholesale changes to Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement have been suggested by some as a way of avoiding a no-deal Brexit, but Coveney told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: “If the approach of the new British prime minister is that they’re going to tear up the withdrawal agreement, I think we’re in trouble. I think we’re all in trouble, quite frankly.“That’s like saying, ‘Either give me what I want or I’m going to burn the house down for everybody’.”A no-deal departure would not be the fault of the EU, Coveney said, but would be entirely down to UK political considerations. If it happened, he added, Ireland would need to impose some form of border checks with Northern Ireland to safeguard its position in the EU single market.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn divorce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Martin BelamHe said: “Just because there’s a change in personality as British prime minister doesn’t mean that the negotiation of the last three years and the solutions that were designed by the British government as much as by the EU aren’t still as relevant and important today as they were six or eight weeks ago.”While the Sunday Times has claimed Ireland and other EU nations could be willing to give way to a Johnson government to avoid no deal, Coveney said major changes to the backstop – the insurance policy to avoid a hard Irish border if no other solution can be found – such as adding a time limit, were simply impossible.“We’ve always said no to that,” he said. “There’s a context around this. You have to be able to answer the question, if asked, of what happens at the end of that time limit. And if you can’t answer that question then it’s not a backstop at all.”The backstop, Coveney said, was “about reassuring people in Northern Ireland that they are not going to go back to the friction and tensions of the past”.He said: “To ask Ireland to compromise on that core issue, when we spent two and a half years working with the British government and the EU to try and find a way to compromise on all sides to ensure that we don’t face that prospect, it is not a reasonable ask, because of a political challenge in Westminster, to move away from that position.”Coveney said he understood only too well what the consequences for Ireland and Northern Ireland would be of no deal, but said this would entirely be down to UK government choices.“It is not where we are now. If the House of Commons chooses to facilitate a no-deal Brexit, and if a new British prime minister chooses to take Britain in that direction, then it will happen. But this will be a British choice. Not an Irish choice, not an EU choice – this is a British choice,” he said.He said everyone wanted to avoid no deal, having worked for three years to do that. “I have done little else in politics apart from focus on the choice of the British people to leave the European Union and its impact on Ireland and the EU,” he added.“We want to try to resolve these issues, but we won’t do it on the basis of being told what must happen because that is the only thing that will pass in the House of Commons.“And international negotiation needs to involve compromise on both sides. We have a deal that has involved compromise on both sides, to facilitate, let’s not forget, British red lines throughout this process. And a new British prime minister doesn’t change that.”In the event of no deal there would be some sort of checks on goods away from the border, Coveney said, to protect Ireland’s place in the EU single market. He added: “What I mean is, we cannot allow an open back door into the EU single market through Northern Ireland. If we do then the Republic of Ireland would be taken out of the single market as well, and I can’t allow that.”","Change in No 10 will not alter Brexit reality, warns Irish deputy

8605,"Claims by Boris Johnson that regulations imposed by “Brussels bureaucrats” were damaging the trade in kippers have been debunked by the European commission, which said that the food safety obligations criticised by him were due to rules set by Britain.Speaking during the final hustings of the Conservative party’s leadership contest on Wednesday night, Johnson held aloft a plastic-wrapped kipper that had come from a fish smoker on the Isle of Man, who he said was “utterly furious”.“After decades of sending them through the post like this he has had his costs massively increased by Brussels bureaucrats who are insisting that each kipper must be accompanied by a plastic ice pillow,” said the MP, who added that it had been presented to him by the editor of a national newspaper.“Pointless, pointless, expensive, environmentally damaging ‘elf and safety’,” Johnson added.However, the European commission hit back against the claims on Thursday, pointing to British government advice, which stresses that foods that need refrigerating must be kept cool while they are being transported – potentially packed in an insulated box with a coolant gel or in a coolbag.A spokesperson for the commission said that while traders had an obligation to meet microbiological requirements to ensure the safety of food, the sale of products from food businesses to consumers was not covered by EU legislation on food hygiene.“The case described by Mr Johnson falls outside the scope of the EU legislation and it’s purely a UK national competence, so I hope this is clear and the rules must be checked with the national authorities,” a commission spokesperson said during a briefing to journalists on Thursday.“There are strict rules when it comes to fish, but these kinds of rules do not apply to processed fishery products. I’m talking about the temperature case that he was explaining.”To cheers and laughter from the party faithful during the hustings at the ExCel Centre in London, Johnson had appeared to riff on the political nickname for Ukip, once feared by Conservative leaders, telling the crowd: “We will bring the kippers back. It’s not a red herring.”Earlier, he had said: “And when we come out therefore, we will not only be able to take back control of our regulatory framework and end this damaging regulatory overkill but we will also be able to do things to boost Britain’s economy, which leads the world in so many sectors.”","Kipper rules Boris Johnson blamed on EU are actually British, says Brussels",2019-07-18/13:56:11,claims by boris johnson that regulations imposed by brussels bureaucrats were damaging the trade in kippers have been debunked by the european commission which said that the food safety obligations criticised by him were due to rules set by britain speaking during the final hustings of the conservative party s leadership contest on wednesday night johnson held aloft a plastic wrapped kipper that had come from a fish smoker on the isle of man who he said was utterly furious after decades of sending them through the post like this he has had his costs massively increased by brussels bureaucrats who are insisting that each kipper must be accompanied by a plastic ice pillow said the mp who added that it had been presented to him by the editor of a national newspaper pointless pointless expensive environmentally damaging elf and safety johnson added however the european commission hit back against the claims on thursday pointing to british government advice which stresses that foods that need refrigerating must be kept cool while they are being transported potentially packed in an insulated box with a coolant gel or in a coolbag a spokesperson for the commission said that while traders had an obligation to meet microbiological requirements to ensure the safety of food the sale of products from food businesses to consumers was not covered by eu legislation on food hygiene the case described by mr johnson falls outside the scope of the eu legislation and it s purely a uk national competence so i hope this is clear and the rules must be checked with the national authorities a commission spokesperson said during a briefing to journalists on thursday there are strict rules when it comes to fish but these kinds of rules do not apply to processed fishery products i m talking about the temperature case that he was explaining to cheers and laughter from the party faithful during the hustings at the excel centre in london johnson had appeared to riff on the political nickname for ukip once feared by conservative leaders telling the crowd we will bring the kippers back it s not a red herring earlier he had said and when we come out therefore we will not only be able to take back control of our regulatory framework and end this damaging regulatory overkill but we will also be able to do things to boost britain s economy which leads the world in so many sectors ,Brexit,0.10880503058433533
8618,"Some unionists in Northern Ireland fear Zimbabwe-style land seizures by Irish nationalists if the region joins a united Ireland, according to a report that lays bare anxieties about any Brexit-fuelled breakup of the UK.Farmers and others with Protestant and unionist backgrounds worry that Catholic and nationalist neighbours would claim their land in a cultural, economic and political takeover by Dublin – “the mother of all fears”, the report found.Based on interviews with focus groups and unionist representatives, the report was published on Thursday. It was compiled by Mark Daly, a senator with Ireland’s main opposition party, Fianna Fáil, to inform Irish policymakers about the implications if Northern Ireland votes to join the Republic despite opposition from unionists, as permitted under the Good Friday agreement.“The reason for the report is to identify the fears and concerns,” Daly said. “Identity is a key one – will roads be renamed, will it become Bobby Sands international airport?”Daly has his own fear: that Ireland will stumble into unity unprepared, unleashing grave, long-term consequences.The senator James Wilson, who served with the British army in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, was commissioned to interview members of the Orange Order, a loyalist flute band and Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) veterans, among others.Some expressed anxiety about losing land that was originally owned or farmed by Catholics displaced more than a century ago.“There are real and genuine fears among the unionist community in Northern Ireland that the land would be taken from them, there would be retribution on members of the security forces and their community’s identity would be lost,” said the report, which runs to 55 pages, with another 200 pages of appendices.Violent land disputes during the partition of Ireland in 1921 and the targeting of land-owning UDR members during the Troubles created a real fear of farm takeovers similar to those seen in Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe, said Daly. “It’s not theoretical. Anytime somebody says that and it’s not addressed, the fear grows.”Other fears include loss of identity, nationalist triumphalism, retribution against former security force members, a return to violence, losing welfare and health care benefits, and rejoining the EU.“For those who cling to the binary, and there are many unionists who do, the fear is that their identity is denied,” wrote one contributor, Mike Nesbitt, a former leader of the Ulster Unionist party.Rev Kyle Paisley, the brother of the Democratic Unionist MP Ian Paisley Jnr, cited fear of swapping the NHS for the Republic’s uneven health care.An unnamed UDR veteran painted a grim scenario of a loyalist uprising overwhelming the Irish army and police. “They would have to raise a Catholic gendarmerie, like the B Specials, and then you will have civil war, way beyond the Troubles II and more like Bosnia.”There was also a strong resolve among some unionists to fight for their rights in the face of a united Ireland. “There is a lot of young loyalists out there who missed the war, champing at the bit for military glory. We need Northern Ireland to work. If it doesn’t, a united Ireland will certainly not work,” said one unionist.Others viewed the Brexit chaos as a lesson to be learned. They saw the prospect of a border poll in the near future – with 50% +1 meaning their exiting the UK and joining a united Ireland – as a corollary of Brexit, which “filled certain cohorts of that demographic with apprehension and loathing”, the report found.The report also stated that the Brexit referendum has demonstrated that a border poll “cannot be rushed or used for political gain” or jeopardise “the hard won peace we all enjoy on this island”.Norman Hamilton, the former moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said he felt those who were pushing for united Ireland “have little skill in, or interest in, uniting communities” which would be necessary for such a major constitutional change.He said he feared a referendum in the foreseeable future “not least because of what has been learned – or not learned – from the recent referendum in the UK”.Paisley said he believed unionists would reject a united Ireland not just on political or religious grounds but because of a lack of unity on the matter and the attraction of the NHS in Northern Ireland.A unionist public representative told the researchers “any talk or discussion on a united Ireland by unionism is seen by many as tantamount to negotiating surrender”.Demographic data shows Northern Ireland Catholics, who tend to be nationalists, will soon outnumber Protestants, who tend to be unionists. A majority – 56% – voted in the 2016 referendum to stay in the EU but Northern Ireland now faces a potentially ruinous exit, burnishing the appeal of a neighbour with EU membership, economic success and social liberalism.",Northern Irish unionists fear post-Brexit land grabs,2019-07-18/07:00:16,some unionists in northern ireland fear zimbabwe style land seizures by irish nationalists if the

representatives the report was published on thursday it was compiled by mark daly a senator with ireland s main opposition party fianna fáil to inform irish policymakers about the implications if northern ireland votes to join the republic despite opposition from unionists as permitted under the good friday agreement the reason for the report is to identify the fears and concerns daly said identity is a key one will roads be renamed will it become bobby sands international airport daly has his own fear that ireland will stumble into unity unprepared unleashing grave long term consequences the senator james wilson who served with the british army in northern ireland during the troubles was commissioned to interview members of the orange order a loyalist flute band and ulster defence regiment udr veterans among others some expressed anxiety about losing land that was originally owned or farmed by catholics displaced more than a century ago there are real and genuine fears among the unionist community in northern ireland that the land would be taken from them there would be retribution on members of the security forces and their community s identity would be lost said the report which runs to  pages with another  pages of appendices violent land disputes during the partition of ireland in  and the targeting of land owning udr members during the troubles created a real fear of farm takeovers similar to those seen in robert mugabe s zimbabwe said daly it s not theoretical anytime somebody says that and it s not addressed the fear grows other fears include loss of identity nationalist triumphalism retribution against former security force members a return to violence losing welfare and health care benefits and rejoining the eu for those who cling to the binary and there are many unionists who do the fear is that their identity is denied wrote one contributor mike nesbitt a former leader of the ulster unionist party rev kyle paisley the brother of the democratic unionist mp ian paisley jnr cited fear of swapping the nhs for the republic s uneven health care an unnamed udr veteran painted a grim scenario of a loyalist uprising overwhelming the irish army and police they would have to raise a catholic gendarmerie like the b specials and then you will have civil war way beyond the troubles ii and more like bosnia there was also a strong resolve among some unionists to fight for their rights in the face of a united ireland there is a lot of young loyalists out there who missed the war champing at the bit for military glory we need northern ireland to work if it doesn t a united ireland will certainly not work said one unionist others viewed the brexit chaos as a lesson to be learned they saw the prospect of a border poll in the near future with   meaning their exiting the uk and joining a united ireland as a corollary of brexit which filled certain cohorts of that demographic with apprehension and loathing the report found the report also stated that the brexit referendum has demonstrated that a border poll cannot be rushed or used for political gain or jeopardise the hard won peace we all enjoy on this island norman hamilton the former moderator of the presbyterian church in ireland said he felt those who were pushing for united ireland have little skill in or interest in uniting communities which would be necessary for such a major constitutional change he said he feared a referendum in the foreseeable future not least because of what has been learned or not learned from the recent referendum in the uk paisley said he believed unionists would reject a united ireland not just on political or religious grounds but because of a lack of unity on the matter and the attraction of the nhs in northern ireland a unionist public representative told the researchers any talk or discussion on a united ireland by unionism is seen by many as tantamount to negotiating surrender demographic data shows northern ireland catholics who tend to be nationalists will soon outnumber protestants who tend to be unionists a majority  voted in the  referendum to stay in the eu but northern ireland now faces a potentially ruinous exit burnishing the appeal of a neighbour with eu membership economic success and social liberalism ,Brexit,0.15874986350536346
8644,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have traded blows in the House of Commons over antisemitism and Islamophobia, each demanding an apology for racism in their respective parties.Corbyn opened May’s penultimate prime minister’s questions on Wednesday by attacking the government’s record on the climate emergency but May switched to criticise Labour over what she called a “failure to deal with racism”.Referring to an advert in the Guardian, which was submitted by 60 Labour peers and criticised Corbyn for the ongoing antisemitism crisis, May said: “There is an issue that needs to be addressed in this house.“He needs to apologise for his failure to deal with racism in the Labour party. Just today, 60 distinguished members of the Labour party have written in the newspapers … You have failed the test of leadership, apologise now.”Corbyn responded by accusing May of a failure to deal with Islamophobia in the Conservative party, which he suggested was more widespread.“When 60% of Tory party members think Islam is a threat to civilisation and as the prime minister has said she will act on Islamophobia in her own party, I hope she will. I look forward to seeing her deal with that and we will deal with any racism in our own party as well,” he said.“Coming from a prime minister who encouraged the hostile environment, deported British citizens who she has now had to compensate, she might look to her own party and her own government’s record as well.”Corbyn said Labour “totally opposes racism in any form whatsoever. Antisemitism has no place in our society and no place in any our parties or any of our dialogue. Neither does any form of racism.”May, who will take her last PMQs next Wednesday before handing over to her successor, repeatedly returned to the issue during the exchange.“We deal with Islamophobia in the Conservative party and any allegations of Islamophobia are dealt with, unlike his way in the Labour party where he is failing to deal with antisemitism,” she said.“The real disgrace is his handling of racism in the Labour party, activists protesting, MPs leaving and staff resigning – what would his great heroes Attlee, Bevan and Benn think? Look what he has done to his party, we will never let him do it to our country.”Labour peers, including more than a dozen former ministers such as Peter Hain, Beverley Hughes and John Reid, addressed the advert to Corbyn. It said: “The Labour party welcomes everyone* irrespective of race, creed, age, gender identity, or sexual orientation. (*except, it seems, Jews.) This is your legacy, Mr Corbyn.”Representing about a third of Labour’s members in the House of Lords, the signatories told Corbyn the party was “no longer a safe place for all members” and claimed thousands had resigned their membership “because of the toxic culture you have allowed to divide our movement”.A survey published last month by Hope Not Hate found widespread Islamophobic attitudes among Conservative members, including nearly two-thirds of Tory activists saying they believed the religion was “a threat to western civilisation”.It also found 54% of Tory members believed Islam was “generally a threat to the British way of life”.Boris Johnson, the Tory leadership frontrunner, was recently criticised for a 2007 essay unearthed by the Guardian in which he claimed Islam had caused the Muslim world to be “literally centuries behind” the west and that “Muslim grievance” was a factor in virtually every conflict.",Corbyn and May trade blows over racism in their parties,2019-07-17/13:37:45,theresa may and jeremy corbyn have traded blows in the house of commons over antisemitism and islamophobia each demanding an apology for racism in their respective parties corbyn opened may s penultimate prime minister s questions on wednesday by attacking the government s record on the climate emergency but may switched to criticise labour over what she called a failure to deal with racism referring to an advert in the guardian which was submitted by  labour peers and criticised corbyn for the ongoing antisemitism crisis may said there is an issue that needs to be addressed in this house he needs to apologise for his failure to deal with racism in the labour party just today  distinguished members of the labour party have written in the newspapers you have failed the test of leadership apologise now corbyn responded by accusing may of a failure to deal with islamophobia in the conservative party which he suggested was more widespread when  of tory party members think islam is a threat to civilisation and as the prime minister has said she will act on islamophobia in her own party i hope she will i look forward to seeing her deal with that and we will deal with any racism in our own party as well he said coming from a prime minister who encouraged the hostile environment deported british citizens who she has now had to compensate she might look to her own party and her own government s record as well corbyn said labour totally opposes racism in any form whatsoever antisemitism has no place in our society and no place in any our parties or any of our dialogue neither does any form of racism may who will take her last pmqs next wednesday before handing over to her successor repeatedly returned to the issue during the exchange we deal with islamophobia in the conservative party and any allegations of islamophobia are dealt with unlike his way in the labour party where he is failing to deal with antisemitism she said the real disgrace is his handling of racism in the labour party activists protesting mps leaving and staff resigning what would his great heroes attlee bevan and benn think look what he has done to his party we will never let him do it to our country labour peers including more than a dozen former ministers such as peter hain beverley hughes and john reid addressed the advert to corbyn it said the labour party welcomes everyone irrespective of race creed age gender identity or sexual orientation except it seems jews this is your legacy mr corbyn representing about a third of labour s members in the house of lords the signatories told corbyn the party was no longer a safe place for all members and claimed thousands had resigned their membership because of the toxic culture you have allowed to divide our movement a survey published last month by hope not hate found widespread islamophobic attitudes among conservative members including nearly two thirds of tory activists saying they believed the religion was a threat to western civilisation it also found  of tory members believed islam was generally a threat to the british way of life boris johnson the tory leadership frontrunner was recently criticised for a  essay unearthed by the guardian in which he claimed islam had caused the muslim world to be literally centuries behind the west and that muslim grievance was a factor in virtually every conflict ,Brexit,0.19104653596878052
8683,"The number of first-time applications for Irish passports from Great Britain has risen sharply since the EU referendum with five times as many people interesting in acquiring one.In Northern Ireland, where all citizens are entitled to an Irish passport, the number of first-time applications has more than doubled. In the year to 30 June, the number of applications from Great Britain was 31,099 and 47,645 from Northern Ireland, according to figures issued in Ireland in response to a parliamentary question to the deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney.This compares with 6,011 applications made from Great Britain in 2015, the year before the referendum, and 20,325 from Northern Ireland.Historical links between the UK and Ireland have meant that Britain has an enduring place in Irish emigration annals, with children and grandchildren of Irish-born citizens entitled to an Irish passport.Interest in acquiring Irish passports has surged since the referendum amid fears of queues at airports and the loss of a host of other rights that come with citizenship, including access to the European health insurance card (EHIC) for health cover while on holiday and the Erasmus university scheme.The Irish government has said it will cover the EHIC and Erasmus costs for Irish citizens in Northern Ireland as part of its commitment to north-south cooperation, as outlined in the Good Friday agreement.The figures show a steady rise since 2015, with application numbers from Great Britain jumping to 18,000 in 2016 and 31,000 the year after. This year’s figures are up 40% on 2018, when the number dropped back to 22,386.In March, the number of overall applications for Irish passports had risen to record levels with almost a quarter of a million requests since January, putting extra strain on passport offices.Coveney said at the time that the 230,000 applications represented a 30% increase on the same period last year.A record 860,000 Irish passports were issued last year, with about 200,000 coming from the UK, but the number is on course to rise even higher this year.",Sharp rise in Britons making applications for Irish passports,2019-07-16/15:06:46,the number of first time applications for irish passports from great britain has risen sharply since the eu referendum with five times as many people interesting in acquiring one in northern ireland where all citizens are entitled to an irish passport the number of first time applications has more than doubled in the year to  june the number of applications from great britain was   and   from northern ireland according to figures issued in ireland in response to a parliamentary question to the deputy prime minister simon coveney this compares with   applications made from great britain in  the year before the referendum and   from northern ireland historical links between the uk and ireland have meant that britain has an enduring place in irish emigration annals with children and grandchildren of irish born citizens entitled to an irish passport interest in acquiring irish passports has surged since the referendum amid fears of queues at airports and the loss of a host of other rights that come with citizenship including access to the european health insurance card ehic for health cover while on holiday and the erasmus university scheme the irish government has said it will cover the ehic and erasmus costs for irish citizens in northern ireland as part of its commitment to north south cooperation as outlined in the good friday agreement the figures show a steady rise since  with application numbers from great britain jumping to   in  and   the year after this year s figures are up  on  when the number dropped back to   in march the number of overall applications for irish passports had risen to record levels with almost a quarter of a million requests since january putting extra strain on passport offices coveney said at the time that the   applications represented a  increase on the same period last year a record   irish passports were issued last year with about   coming from the uk but the number is on course to rise even higher this year ,Brexit,0.18399670720100403
8695,"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt’s Brexit plan to axe the Irish border backstop from the withdrawal agreement will be rejected outright by the European Union, EU sources have said.Informed sources say it is doomed to failure and if the next prime minister goes to Brussels with such a proposal, he will be told in “no uncertain terms” that it amounts to a declaration of no deal.Brussels had already rebuffed such a plan when the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, who is part of Johnson’s campaign, met the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, last week.In what was seen as “spinning for a Boris plan”, Barclay told Barnier five times during the meeting that the backstop was dead. Sources say he told Barnier they wanted a series of mini-deals and alternative arrangements for the Irish border.He was told that was Brexit fantasy and a non-starter, and that the “mini-deals” outlined in EU contingency plans were temporary and covered only the “bare bones” such as aviation, mobile phone roaming and haulier driving licences. They did not include the major issues such as trade or the Irish border.The EU is watching developments in the UK very closely and has already prepared responses on a range of possibilities including a call for the EU to endorse the so-called “Brady amendment”, which was passed in the House of Commons in January. It called for the backstop, or the mechanism by which a hard border will be avoided on the island of Ireland in case there is no post-Brexit free trade agreement, to be scrapped.This will also be rejected.Johnson and Hunt have declared the Northern Ireland backstop “dead” and promised to throw it out of any deal they negotiate with the EU, in comments that significantly harden their Brexit positions.Variously described as an insurance policy or safety net, the backstop is a device in the withdrawal agreement intended to ensure that there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, even if no formal deal can be reached on trade and security arrangements.It would mean that if there were no workable agreement on such matters, Northern Ireland would stay in the customs union and much of the single market, guaranteeing a friction-free border with the Republic. This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU’s customs union permanently if the UK & EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc. Joint interpretative instrument A legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try to get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU’s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.Unilateral statement from the UK This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.Additional language in political declaration This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like. However, it failed to persuade the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who said that while it ‘reduces the risk’ of the UK being trapped in a backstop indefinitely, it does not remove it.Boris Johnson declared the Northern Ireland backstop ‘dead’ during his leadership campaign, and promised to throw it out of any deal he renegotiated with the EU. The EU has repeatedly stated that it will not reopen the withdrawal agreement for renegotiation. Daniel Boffey, Martin Belam and Peter Walker While their words may be the source of alarm, the Irish fully expected this and see it as campaign spin.Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, said in a radio interview over the weekend that he would give whoever became prime minister “a fair hearing” but warned that the victor would be in for a “reality check” when he got the keys to Downing Street.“Politicians when they are in campaign mode, and both of those men are in campaign mode, tend to campaign in poetry, in simple terms and high-level messages.“When you get into office you have to govern in prose, and I imagine whoever is the new prime minister is going to face a very serious reality check when they sit down with their officials,” he told Pat Kenny on Newstalk.The Irish senator and Brexit spokesman Neale Richmond said on Tuesday the remarks did not mean Ireland would be budging on the backstop. “The backstop is a vital aspect of the withdrawal agreement, an aspect that was developed in light of the UK government’s own red lines.“While it is no one’s preferred destination, it gives all sides the vital insurance policy to allow a new relationship between the EU and the UK to be formulated. The withdrawal agreement is the only vehicle towards a managed Brexit. It won’t be reopened.”On Monday night, the Tory leadership rivals both ruled out trying to tweak the backstop, which critics say could trap the UK indefinitely in a customs union with the EU.The EU is watching carefully and is expecting that if Johnson, the frontrunner, is selected, he will make immediate plans to fly to Brussels and Dublin for talks.If he decides to make his first visit the US, this will “embolden” EU member states because it will send a clear signal that he deems the US more important than the EU, the UK’s biggest trading partner.There is an expectation that Johnson and his negotiators will come to Brussels in September with an early outline of his new Brexit plan. But EU sources warn it will have to be tested first in parliament because they will not waste time negotiating anything that does not have a mandate in the House of Commons.The new UK prime minister might seek a string of protocols on alternative arrangements that would guarantee the backstop would never be used.“That would mean an insurance policy that would never be used. There would be no point to that,” said an EU source.Varadkar said in a lengthy interview with Kenny that Ireland was prepared for no deal but he hoped it would not happen.“It will be incredibly severe on Northern Ireland because it will face tariffs … and will face huge difficulties, because a huge amount of trade from Northern Ireland goes through Dublin.“The impact on Northern Ireland will be more severe than anywhere in Europe. The impact on the UK and Ireland would be pretty severe too.

8764,"The government’s decision to send a second Royal Navy warship to the Gulf will intensify concerns that Britain is unintentionally sliding into armed conflict with Iran. The deployment of HMS Duncan, a Type 45 destroyer, will be seen in Tehran as a gratuitous escalation of an already tense regional situation. It may help improve security for the 15 or more British-owned oil tankers that traverse the Gulf each day – or it may worsen it. The move potentially turns the warships and the tankers into targets, should Donald Trump impetuously decide to start a war.Once again, Britain is being dragged along by international events, lacking an independent, well-considered policy, compromising its principles, and at the mercy of more powerful antagonists. This sense of drift, of a rudderless ship of state bobbing haplessly in hostile waters, is pervasive and alarming. To say it is the product of temporary uncertainty, caused by a change of prime minister, is to underestimate the problem. In this respect, Boris Johnson is both symbol and symptom of a deeper malaise.Britain is in the grip of a fundamental crisis of confidence that is negatively affecting its governance, its institutions and its place in the world, and it is a crisis that appears to be worsening. Historians may one day trace its roots into the distant past but for now, it is enough to say that this national haemorrhage of shared purpose and belief began in earnest in June 2016, when Britain voted to leave the EU. The subsequent controversy, and resulting impasse, have proved uniquely corrosive and damaging.John Sawers, a former MI6 chief and seasoned diplomat with no particular axe to grind, warned recently that Britain was experiencing “a political nervous breakdown” for which no remedy was in sight. He questioned the calibre of politicians, Conservative and Labour, who seek to lead the country amid great anxiety and division. Whoever next enters Downing Street, he said, would be launching into an immense gamble: “As we leave the European Union, we take a huge risk to our international standing [and] to the strength of the British economy.”Extreme nervousness among government officials, civil servants and diplomats that Britain, as presently run and organised, may not be equal to this challenge is everywhere apparent. One key indicator is virtual paralysis in parliament and Whitehall over both Brexit and non-Brexit matters; the current policy vacuum is simply staggering. Another indicator is collapsed rules of collective cabinet responsibility. Yet another is the reports, seeping out almost daily, that government departments are unprepared for Brexit, that civil servants are overwhelmed, and that no-deal chaos awaits on 31 October.Reports seep out that government departments are unprepared for Brexit, civil servants are overwhelmed, no-deal chaos awaitsThe recent torrent of unauthorised disclosures of confidential material speaks of a system close to breaking point. Last May saw an unprecedented breach at the National Security Council, relating to the Chinese company, Huawei. Last week’s indefensible leaking of critical views of Trump privately expressed by Kim Darroch, Britain’s ambassador to Washington, also reflects this wider internal governmental breakdown. Darroch’s understandable but regrettable resignation was yet another shock to the government’s central nervous system.The impact of this betrayal on Britain’s diplomats based overseas, and on civil servants generally, is potentially very serious. Who can now be trusted in a dangerous, treacherous and competitive world if your own side is ready to sell you down the river? What to do when politicians such as Johnson will not hesitate to throw you “under the bus”, as the Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan put it, if it helps further their personal ambitions?Johnson’s conduct in the Darroch affair, and his weaselly attempts to exculpate himself, is a disgrace. This alone should disqualify him from the premiership. But while that outcome seems unlikely, what is more certain is that foreign predators are watching Britain’s neurosis with keen anticipation. Reacting to mild criticism over recent violence in Hong Kong, China rudely told Britain to mind its own business. Sensing weakness, the hard men in Beijing will do all in their not inconsiderable power to turn British discomfiture to future advantage.Expect no less of Vladimir Putin. Theresa May’s decision to briefly meet Russia’s president at the G20 summit in Japan was a typically British attempt to keep open lines of communication, even when her interlocutor is guilty of the most brazen acts – not least, last year’s Salisbury poisonings. Yet Putin’s motivation was all crude calculation, zero goodwill. He hopes to prise a disoriented, post-EU Britain away from its transatlantic anchors. Other countries are circling, too, seeking choice pickings from the Brexit carcass.And then there is Trump’s America, leading Britain by the nose into another Middle East war of choice, treating its ambassador like a mere flunky, personally insulting the prime minister, demanding a trade deal on invidious terms, and all the time undermining the international rules-based order that postwar Britain has spent decades building and nurturing. Little wonder that the EU looks on aghast. Europeans are among the few friends Britain has left – yet they are wilfully, neurotically spurned.

8916,"A no-deal Brexit is an “ugly prospect” that will oblige Ireland to impose customs checks on trade with Northern Ireland, the Irish government has warned.Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, made a grim prognosis on Tuesday of the “dire” consequences if the UK crashes out of the EU.“A no-deal Brexit is an ugly prospect. It will put many businesses and many people under a great deal of strain,” he told a press conference in Dublin.The tánaiste was speaking after the Irish government released a 117-page report outlining the country’s contingency plans for no deal.“It will put political relationships on this island under a great deal of strain, in my view. It will make it more difficult for the institutions of the Good Friday agreement to function and it will be a fundamental disruptor to the all-island economy.”Coveney said that to protect the EU’s single market, Ireland would check trade between the republic and Northern Ireland. “We will need to take some action somewhere … but we will not put checks on the border, or close to it.”He said Dublin was working with the European commission to balance such checks with the need to avoid a hard border and protect the Good Friday agreement, but refused to say how this would be achieved. “There is no evil plan on a shelf somewhere.”After a special cabinet meeting, the Irish government released the report outlining “very damaging” consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the political process in Northern Ireland, adding that it “risks significantly undermining wider community relations and political stability … with potential related security concerns”.The report also reveals that additional gardaí have been deployed to border areas in recent months, and that more will be sent immediately in the event of no deal.But “there should be no illusion” over the impact of Brexit on the island, with 11 risks identified including the undermining of community relations and political stability in Northern Ireland.The report also put paid to Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt’s hopes that the EU will accept technology-based “alternative arrangements” for the Irish border.It says it has been working with the European commission on this issue this year but “no one has yet come up with any alternatives that meet the same objectives as the withdrawal agreement”.Report says since last year Irl has been working with EC on no deal. ""No one has yet come up with any alternatives that meet the same objectives as the Withdrawal Agreement."" pic.twitter.com/YE5OTLksTOThe report says the government’s assessment is that there is now “a significant risk of a no-deal on 31 October” and preparation for such an event is a priority.It warns of a potential £6bn cost to the Irish economy and an estimated increase in unemployment of 50,000-55,000.“Preventing the emergence of a hard border on the island of Ireland remains of the highest priority,” says the report, but despite preparations “without the withdrawal agreement and the backstop, there are no easy answers”.The biggest challenge will be how to continue cross-border trade involving animals and agricultural products.In a no-deal scenario, all food and animals from Northern Ireland will be treated as sourced from a third country and not eligible to enter the EU without checks on traceability and disease.As expected, the report does not say how these would be accommodated and says further talks with the European commission are needed. The report warns of “disruption in north-south trade and the all-island economy due to tariffs and the imposition of various regulatory requirements”, and to cooperation in areas such as energy, road and rail connectivity. The Irish government has been caught in a bind, refusing to discuss plans for the border in the event of no deal because that would risk legitimising a disorderly exit. At the same time, it is aware of its EU obligations to protect the single market from third-country goods.The report says at least 24 hours’ notice will have to be given for goods going from the UK into Ireland. About 400 additional customs staff have been recruited with 190 staff in the Department of Agriculture to conduct import controls.Séamus Nevin, the chief economist of Make UK, the British manufacturers’ association, said the plan to oblige UK traders to give 24 hours’ notice to Irish authorities was a “serious challenge to the viability of any Northern Irish manufacturer or farming business”.Given the nature of modern supply chains and just-in-time deliveries, “the Dublin government is playing serious hardball and calling Her Majesty’s government’s bluff”.","No-deal Brexit a

8936,"Jeremy Corbyn has sought to draw a line under Labour’s Brexit travails by announcing a “settled” policy of backing remain in any referendum called on a Conservative deal.The Labour leader has been under intense pressure to shift to an overtly anti-Brexit stance, but has insisted on consulting the party’s stakeholders in recent weeks, including the trade unions.In a statement emailed to party members on Tuesday, Corbyn made no reference to what stance Labour would take in the event of a general election in the near future, or whether Labour could enter such a contest saying it would still go ahead with leaving the European Union.But he made clear that if a referendum was called on the Brexit deal negotiated by the incoming Conservative prime minister – or on whether to go ahead with a no-deal Brexit – Labour would support remain.Corbyn wrote: “Whoever becomes the new prime minister should have the confidence to put their deal, or no deal, back to the people in a public vote. In those circumstances, I want to make it clear that Labour would campaign for remain against either no deal or a Tory deal that does not protect the economy and jobs.”The trade unions published a statement on Monday that suggested Labour should seek to negotiate its own, better Brexit deal and then put that to the people, but declined to specify how the party would campaign in the event of that happening.Corbyn acknowledged the issue of Brexit had “been divisive in our communities and sometimes in our party too”. He defended Labour’s position over the past three years, saying it had been right to respect the result of the 2016 referendum.“Labour set out a compromise plan to try to bring the country together based around a customs union, a strong single market relationship and protection of environmental regulations and rights at work. We continue to believe this is a sensible alternative that could bring the country together,” Corbyn said.With Labour under intense pressure from more overtly pro-remain parties, including the Liberal Democrats, the party had already shifted since the European elections towards urging the Conservatives to put their deal to a public vote. But Corbyn had previously stopped short of saying Labour would campaign for remain in the event of a referendum being called.In an interview with the BBC on Tuesday, he said there was no decision yet as to what Labour would argue for in a general election on Brexit. He said: “We will decide very quickly at the start of that campaign exactly what our position will be.”Pressed on whether Labour was now a party of leave or remain, Corbyn said: “We will give people the choice on this. That is something which is surely very important. We respect the result of the referendum. We’ve been through this whole long parliamentary process over the past three years and we’ve made it very clear we will do everything we can to take no deal off the table or stop a damaging deal of the sort Hunt and Johnson are proposing.”Corbyn believes the fact that both sides of the party have signed up to the new policy vindicates his approach of moving gradually, and only after extensive consultation.Labour also hopes that it can now set aside the Brexit row, and gain more of a hearing for other domestic policies.Differences in the shadow cabinet over Brexit policy have repeatedly been played out in public in recent months, with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, joining calls for his party to adopt a remain stance.The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, was dropped from deputising for Corbyn at prime minister’s questions after criticising the party’s position during TV coverage of the European election results. “We were not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear,” she said.Corbyn’s deputy, Tom Watson, has publicly urged party members to make their disquiet about Labour’s position known by signing up to a remain “declaration”.But their

9180,"The problem with assessing the intentions of a serial liar is that disbelief becomes second nature. So when Boris Johnson stated his Brexit plans in interviews last week and over the weekend it was largely overlooked. The media and public preferred to focus Johnson’s absurd claim that he enjoys arts and crafts of the vehicular variety. Less a dead cat than a dead kitten.What makes Johnson’s intentions even harder to assess is his absence of principles. He belongs to a vanishingly small group of Britons who believe in neither leave nor remain. It is not that he has changed his mind but that he has never much cared either way. For Johnson, Brexit was a passing bandwagon to the premiership, and he was prepared to climb aboard. It is testament to his political skill that he has hoodwinked the Brexit zealots into believing he is their man.So could he be Johnson the pretender, the man who seized the Brexit crown only to betray those who handed it to him?Johnson claimed that his “plan A” was to leave “with a standstill between the UK and the EU so we keep going with the existing arrangements until such time as we have completed our free trade agreement and we use that period to solve the questions of the Northern Irish border”. Rather than pausing the process inside the EU, it seems that Johnson might propose to park Britain just the other side of the line. 31 October would be a symbolic exit, legally out but practically in – Brexit in name only. It would be a dropkick of the can down the road.Can Johnson really believe it is possible to hoodwink the nation with a wheeze that leaves us in the EU but with no say?Such a plan could perhaps be described as the “backstop triple-plus” – that is, the customs union plus the single market, free movement and the full financial contribution. It would take the original 21-month transition negotiated by Theresa May and reformulate it to be “as short as possible, as long as necessary”. Doubtless the political declaration would commit to a Canada-style free trade agreement, a mutually agreed target end date for the negotiations, and empty promises to explore alternative arrangements for the Irish border. Is this what is giving Johnson “supreme confidence” that we will be out of the EU “do or die”?It could be a superficially attractive option, which might appear capable of achieving a majority in parliament. As it wouldn’t really mean leaving, it would surely meet Labour’s “six tests”. It would unite Labour MPs from strongly Brexit-supporting constituencies, such as Lisa Nandy, with those who have advocated a Norway-style agreement, such as Stephen Kinnock. Johnson may calculate that it would deliver enough Labour votes to cancel out the irreducible core of European Research Group (ERG) opponents. The EU itself would be delighted: no impediments to the single market, the weight of the UK economy in trade negotiations, and our sizeable financial contribution with none of the aggravation caused by British Europhobes. Crudely, the UK would effectively remain in the club, albeit with no say, and Nigel Farage would be kicked out of the European parliament to boot.But it is also a plan that is doomed to failure. If such a proposal were to be made, it would come unstuck in precisely the same way that May’s deal died on the backstop. The EU simply does not believe that alternative arrangements are possible for the Irish border. So the EU will refuse to commit to a legally binding end date for such a transition period. Johnson is badly miscalculating if he thinks the EU will abandon Ireland for the sake of a deal with the UK. Moreover, given how advantageous this arrangement would be to other EU member states, there would be virtually no incentive for negotiations on the future partnership to ever reach a conclusion.It would be quite the comeuppance for leave campaigners. After decades of poisoning Britain’s relations with our neighbours and three years of squabbling, the only Brexit they could make work would be one where we never really leave but give up control rather than take it back. Stubbornness would be its animating purpose; the Brexit project would have defeated itself. Shrewd Brexiters would know the clock will be ticking until the UK goes from such a standstill transition back to full membership, only with a worse deal than today, losing both the rebate and the opt-outs we currently enjoy.As a result, it would not face the 34 Tory opponents from May’s third attempt to pass the withdrawal agreement but more like the 75 who voted against it at the second attempt. Even if they believed that we would eventually arrive at a free trade agreement, the typical negotiation length is five to seven years, meaning as much as an additional £80bn in financial contributions with no say over how they are spent, the continuation of free movement (good for the country but detested by many Brexiters) and the entirety of EU regulation. So much for the promise of “taking back control of our laws, borders and money”.What’s more, if this is his strategy, Johnson is also badly misreading the mood of the Labour party. Sentiment is drifting away from a second referendum and towards revoking article 50 by a parliamentary vote. But more than that, this sort of plan would face fierce hostility from Jeremy Corbyn himself. Corbyn’s long-held Euroscepticism is firmly in the Bennite tradition: opposed to the EU on grounds of democracy and accountability. Labour’s six tests for Brexit would be replaced by Tony Benn’s five questions for the powerful. A solution that leaves Britain effectively in the EU but with no say runs entirely counter to his principles. If there was any plan that could provoke Corbyn from acquiescence to Brexit into outright opposition, this would be it.Even if it were to pass parliament, it would provoke an immediate general election. The government has a working majority of just three, and if Johnson were to deceive the ERG in this way, they would surely prevent him from being able to govern. It would provide the Brexit party with the perfect narrative of betrayal: leavers would say “we never left”, and remainers would ask “what was the point?” Both would be right. Can Johnson really believe it is possible to hoodwink the nation with a wheeze that leaves us in the EU but with no say? With the right split between the Tories and the Brexit party, it is hard to see the path to a general election victory in November. For that reason, the most likely outcome continues to be an October election prior to a no-deal exit, where Johnson calculates that he will have five clear years to clean up the mess and turn things around. And gaining and retaining power for himself is the only principle to which Johnson has ever shown any fidelity.• Tom Kibasi is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research and chair of the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice.

9229,"Supporters of the two Conservative leadership candidates have sought to play down the chances of a no-deal Brexit, after business groups reiterated their warnings about the economic damage this could wreak.Liam Fox, a supporter of Jeremy Hunt – who said on Sunday he would be willing to tell businesses that went bust because of no deal that it was a necessary sacrifice – said a new EU commission should be willing to make a deal.Meanwhile Matt Hancock, who after dropping out of the race himself threw his support behind Boris Johnson, said Johnson’s hard-and-fast deadline of 31 October meant departure with a deal was more likely.Business groups and Conservative sources expressed alarm after Hunt, normally seen as the more moderate of the pair on Brexit, told the BBC he would push for no deal if, by the start of October, there was no chance of a new negotiated settlement.Asked whether he would be willing to look the owners of family businesses in the eye and say they should be prepared to see their companies go bust to ensure a no-deal Brexit, Hunt said: “I would do so but I’d do it with a heavy heart precisely because of the risks.”At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn divorce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Martin BelamFox, the international trade secretary, said that while the UK was “not entirely in control” of whether no deal happened, he believed it would not.“You have got a new commission coming in, and we will have a new prime minister. The European Union have to listen to the economic realities,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live.“It’s rational. Britain is not asking for anything that’s unreasonable. We’re simply saying: we have an agreement to leave the European Union. We want some changes to the backstop arrangement to make it get through parliament. And then we can leave with a deal, which is in everybody’s interests.”However, Fox stressed he would prefer no deal to a second Brexit referendum.“It’s up to us to be very clear to the European Union that we want a deal, but if we can’t get one that’s satisfactory, we can’t get one that goes through parliament, then the default position within our law is that we leave without a deal, and we have to make the proper preparations so that is a credible position,” he said.Hunt was on Monday due to make a speech setting out a 10-point plan to mitigate the effects of no deal, including £6bn to protect fishing and agriculture. It would also include a new, dedicated committee with special powers to boost no-deal planning and a logistics committee to assist with imports and exports.Fox denied no deal would be disastrous, saying: “I’m not sure it would be catastrophic. I think that there would be problems, and that’s exactly what Jeremy Hunt is setting out today.”Hancock, the health secretary, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Johnson’s pledge to leave on 31 October “do or die” minimised the risk of no deal.“The reason that I’m [backing] Boris Johnson is because I think he’s best placed to deliver Brexit and then to unite the country,” he said.“The best way to deliver Brexit is with a deadline, and Boris is the only candidate with a deadline. No deadline risks no Brexit, and slip-sliding towards a second referendum, which I don’t want to see.”Hancock had a very different approach to Brexit when he was still in the race, and was challenged repeatedly on how he could now support Johnson. “You’ve got to look forward in life,” he said.Hancock indicated he still disliked the idea of proroguing, or suspending, the Commons to stop MPs blocking no deal, but refused to condemn Johnson for not ruling this out as a tactic.“I don’t foresee that happening. The whole point of Brexit – this where he and I strongly agree – is to return parliamentary sovereignty to the UK,” he said, adding: “I don’t think that that is where this is going to end up.”Hancock explained why he was now backing Johnson: “I clearly made my case to win, and I didn’t get the support in order to be able to proceed, and then you deal with the world as it is. And you have to ask the question: who is best placed to deliver Brexit? Answer: Boris Johnson.”He said: “Part of being able to deliver, when you’re in government, when you’re in politics, is about uniting people who have a range of views. And Boris’s ability to bring people behind him from different parts of the party is a great strength, and by God that’s needed.”",Brexit: both Tory sides play down risk of no-deal after business alarm,2019-07-01/10:49:11,supporters of the two conservative leadership candidates have sought to play down the chances of a no deal brexit after business groups reiterated their warnings about the economic damage this could wreak liam fox a supporter of jeremy hunt who said on sunday he would be willing to tell businesses that went bust because of no deal that it was a necessary sacrifice said a new eu commission should be willing to make a deal meanwhile matt hancock who after dropping out of the race himself threw his support behind boris johnson said johnson s hard and fast deadline of  october meant departure with a deal was more likely business groups and conservative sources expressed alarm after hunt normally seen as the more moderate of the pair on brexit told the bbc he would push for no deal if by the start of october there was no chance of a new negotiated settlement asked whether he would be willing to look the owners of family businesses in the eye and say they should be prepared to see their companies go bust to ensure a no deal brexit hunt said i would do so but i d do it with a heavy heart precisely because of the risks at pm uk time on  october the uk would by default become a third country in terms of relations with the eu with no overarching post brexit plan in place and no transition period the uk would no longer be paying into the eu budget nor would it hand over the bn divorce payment the uk would drop out of countless arrangements pacts and treaties covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people foodstuffs other goods and data to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation and policing and security without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed in the immediate aftermath without a deal the uk would trade with the eu on the default terms of the world trade organization wto including tariffs on agricultural goods the uk government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country this would lower the price of imports making it harder for british manufacturers to compete with foreign goods if the uk sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the eu under wto most favoured nation rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries wto rules only cover goods they do not apply to financial services a significant part of the uk s economy trading under wto rules will also require border checks which could cause delays at ports and a severe challenge to the peace process in ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border some no deal supporters have claimed that the uk can use article  of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt to force the eu to accept a period of up to  years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated however the uk cannot invoke article  unilaterally the eu would have to agree to it in previous cases where the article has been used the two sides had a deal in place and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the eu and the uk s trading relationship the director general of the wto roberto azevêdo has told prospect magazine that in simple factual terms in this scenario you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the uk and eu where currently there are none until some agreements are in place a no deal scenario will place extra overheads on uk businesses eg the current government advice is that all drivers including lorries and commercial vehicles will require extra documentation to be able to drive in europe after  october if there is no deal those arguing for a managed no deal envisage that a range of smaller sector by sector bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self interest between the uk and eu to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy martin belamfox the international trade secretary said that while the uk was not entirely in control of whether no deal happened he believed it would not you have got a new commission coming in and we will have a new prime minister the european union have to listen to the economic realities he told bbc radio  live it s rational britain is not asking for anything that s unreasonable we re simply saying we have an agreement to leave the european union we want some changes to the backstop arrangement to make it get through parliament and then we can leave with a deal which is in everybody s interests however fox stressed he would prefer no deal to a second brexit referendum it s up to us to be very clear to the european union that we want a deal but if we can t get one that s satisfactory we can t get one that goes through parliament then the default position within our law is that we leave without a deal and we have to make the proper preparations so that is a credible position he said hunt was on monday due to make a speech setting out a  point plan to mitigate the effects of no deal including bn to protect fishing and agriculture it would also include a new dedicated committee with special powers to boost no deal planning and a logistics committee to assist with imports and exports fox denied no deal would be disastrous saying i m not sure it would be catastrophic i think that there would be problems and that s exactly what

9350,"Brussels has sounded a warning that Boris Johnson’s familiar use of “false promises, pseudo-patriotism and foreigner-bashing” to win the keys to Downing Street is locking Britain into a no-deal Brexit.In a withering attack on the Conservative leadership frontrunner, Guy Verhofstadt dismissed the idea that he could dump Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, withhold payment of the UK’s £39bn divorce bill and still negotiate a free-trade deal in Brussels as a “myth”. And he said that, years after the referendum, Johnson was “a man who continues to dissemble, exaggerate and disinform”.Verhofstadt’s assessment, which is shared by most European officials, is the most forceful European intervention so far into the Tories’ leadership election. In an article published by the Project Syndicate website and the Guardian, the former prime minister of Belgium concludes that Johnson and his rival, Jeremy Hunt, who also claims to be able to to renegotiate the Brexit deal, have “learned nothing whatsoever” from the last two years.The EU has repeatedly said it will not renegotiate the agreement and that the UK will crash out unless the House of Commons ratifies the full package, including the protocol containing the Irish backstop for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.But Johnson has said he believes that with “positive energy” he will be able to either persuade Brussels to ditch the backstop, which would otherwise keep the UK in a customs union until another border solution is found, or agree to a “standstill” in current relations through article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade.The latter claim has been described as “not true” by the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, among others. He pointed out article 24 requires EU agreement, which Brussels has said it will not give.EU officials and diplomats close to the last two years of talks have looked on aghast at the hardening of Johnson’s positions around what they regard as unfeasible proposals.Sources echoed Verhofstadt’s concerns on Thursday, saying that they feared an early visit to Brussels by Johnson, on becoming prime minister, could lock both sides into a no-deal Brexit.Officials said it would be desirable for Johnson to instead tour the EU capitals in order to gain a sense of what might be realistic before seeking concessions.One EU diplomat said there would be a natural desire to give a new prime minister a hearing but that there increasingly seemed little hope of reaching an accommodation.“Is the withdrawal agreement really dead?” asked one. “It’s crazy.”“You could possibly foresee add-ons to the deal to offer aspirational timelines for getting out of the Irish backstop,” said the source. “Maybe he could sell it at home. But Johnson is backing himself more into a corner every day.”EU diplomats said they recognised that much of Johnson’s positioning was designed to put the blame on the bloc for a no-deal exit.One diplomat said: “Without the withdrawal treaty there will be no standstill transition. It is in the draft treaty, nowhere else. The idea that the EU would stand by as Britain tears up a painstakingly negotiated treaty and then say, ‘Hey have a transition anyway,’ is frankly ridiculous.“Is Johnson serious? I hope he understands what he’s on about because no else does.“It is nonsense and is presumably meant to be incomprehensible for the purposes of his campaign unless he is completely divorced from reality.”In his article, Verhofstadt described Johnson in similar terms, saying that he appeared to be unable to stop spreading “untruths”.He added: “Chief among them is the myth that Britain can tear up the withdrawal agreement that May negotiated with the EU, withhold its financial commitments to the bloc and simultaneously start negotiating free-trade deals.“To Johnson’s followers, however, he is more prophet than politician: only he can deliver a mythical ‘true Brexit’ that will deliver the prosperity promised during the referendum campaign.“As is often the case with populists, reality does not square with Johnson’s ensorcelling combination of false promises, pseudo-patriotism and foreigner-bashing.“He and his fellow Brexiteers speak of a ‘global Britain’ that will trade freely with the rest of the world, even as they drag their country down a path strewn with uprooted trade ties and substantial new barriers to commerce.”The EU is due to announce the finalising of a trade deal with the Mercosur bloc – Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay – that will reduce tariffs on European products being exported to those countries.The EU has been keen to burnish its trade credentials after enjoying a purple patch of negotiations, including with Japan, with which it has struck the world’s largest bilateral free-trade deal.“With Johnson likely taking power in late July, Europe will have offered still more proof that Brexit is not only unnecessary but also detrimental to Britain’s economic interests,” Verhofstadt writes. “The ‘buccaneering’ Brexiteers might then finally have to explain what it is they’re still complaining about.”","Boris Johnson's foreigner-bashing tying UK to no-deal Brexit, says Brussels",2019-06-27/19:43:11,brussels has sounded a warning

9361,"French carmaker PSA Group has warned that it will only build its new Vauxhall Astra at its Ellesmere Port plant if the UK avoids a no-deal Brexit, in a stark indication of the importance of trade with the EU to the British car industry.The Astra is the bestselling model under the Vauxhall and Opel brands and will be built in Germany as well as at Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool, if severe Brexit disruption is avoided, PSA said on Thursday.However, PSA, the parent company of the Peugeot, Citroen and Vauxhall brands, gave a clear warning against a bad Brexit deal, which could disrupt the just-in-time deliveries on which high-volume carmakers depend.In its announcement, PSA said: “The decision on the allocation to the Ellesmere Port plant will be conditional on the final terms of the UK’s exit from the European Union and the acceptance of the New Vehicle Agreement, which has been negotiated with the Unite trade union.”The warning underlined the urgent calls from across the British car industry for a Brexit deal that avoids delays or tariffs at the UK border. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders this week warned that every extra minute of delay of goods at the border would cost the industry £50,000.If Astra production goes ahead in the UK under a smooth Brexit, the decision to build the vehicle at Ellesmere Port would be a major boost for the embattled British car industry and the 1,000 employees at the plant. Securing the new contract is thought to be vital for the future of the factory.Yet Boris Johnson, who won the largest vote from MPs in the first stage of the Conservative party leadership election, has said that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, “do or die”. PSA executives have not met Johnson. PSA also owns a Vauxhall plant in Luton, where it employs 1,200 people making the Vivaro van.Mick Chalmers, regional coordinating officer for the Unite trade union, said a no-deal Brexit would destroy Ellesmere Port’s “hope of securing the plant’s long-term future”.Ellesmere Port, which currently manufactures the Astra, beat off competition from a plant in Gliwice, Poland. The new model will be built from 2021 onwards, and will secure electric car production in the UK, an important consideration as the industry moves away from the combustion engine.PSA’s chief executive, Carlos Tavares, has previously made it clear the carmaker would not shy away from unpopular decisions, including shutting factories, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Fears over the Ellesmere Port plant’s future have swirled within the industry since the Brexit vote, although the fact that PSA held off making a decision – even as Honda and Ford announced closures of British factories – led some analysts to believe the company was keen to preserve it.The plant’s survival was probably aided by the quick turnaround of the Opel-Vauxhall business, which was bought by PSA for £1.9bn from US carmaker General Motors in 2017.Opel–Vauxhall reported its first annual profits in 20 years in 2018 after a major cost-cutting plan. During General Motors’ ownership, the company made $19bn (£15bn) in accumulated losses but Opel-Vauxhall made a profit of €859m in 2018.",Vauxhall Astra to be built in UK if ministers avoid no-deal Brexit,2019-06-27/16:23:47,french carmaker psa group has warned that it will only build its new vauxhall astra at its ellesmere port plant if the uk avoids a no deal brexit in a stark indication of the importance of trade with the eu to the british car industry the astra is the bestselling model under the vauxhall and opel brands and will be built in germany as well as at ellesmere port near liverpool if severe brexit disruption is avoided psa said on thursday however psa the parent company of the peugeot citroen and vauxhall brands gave a clear warning against a bad brexit deal which could disrupt the just in time deliveries on which high volume carmakers depend in its announcement psa said the decision on the allocation to the ellesmere port plant will be conditional on the final terms of the uk s exit from the european union and the acceptance of the new vehicle agreement which has been negotiated with the unite trade union the warning underlined the urgent calls from across the british car industry for a brexit deal that avoids delays or tariffs at the uk border the society of motor manufacturers and traders this week warned that every extra minute of delay of goods at the border would cost the industry   if astra production goes ahead in the uk under a smooth brexit the decision to build the vehicle at ellesmere port would be a major boost for the embattled british car industry and the   employees at the plant securing the new contract is thought to be vital for the future of the factory yet boris johnson who won the largest vote from mps in the first stage of the conservative party leadership election has said that the uk will leave the eu on  october do or die psa executives have not met johnson psa also owns a vauxhall plant in luton where it employs   people making the vivaro van mick chalmers regional coordinating officer for the unite trade union said a no deal brexit would destroy ellesmere port s hope of securing the plant s long term future ellesmere port which currently manufactures the astra beat off competition from a plant in gliwice poland the new model will be built from  onwards and will secure electric car production in the uk an important consideration as the industry moves away from the combustion engine psa s chief executive carlos tavares has previously made it clear the carmaker would not shy away from unpopular decisions including shutting factories in the event of a no deal brexit fears over the ellesmere port plant s future have swirled within the industry since the brexit vote although the fact that psa held off making a decision even as honda and ford announced closures of british factories led some analysts to believe the company was keen to preserve it the plant s survival was probably aided by the quick turnaround of the opel vauxhall business which was bought by psa for  bn from us carmaker general motors in  opel vauxhall reported its first annual profits in  years in  after a major cost cutting plan during general motors ownership the company made bn bn in accumulated losses but opel vauxhall made a profit of m in  ,Brexit,0.179876908659935
9378,"Japan’s foreign minister has pleaded with Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt not to lead the UK out of the EU without a deal when one of them becomes prime minister.In an unusually blunt warning, Tarō Kōno suggested Japanese companies operating in the UK would relocate to other countries in Europe in the event of a no-deal Brexit.“There are over 1,000 Japanese companies operating in the United Kingdom, so we are very concerned with this no-deal Brexit,” Kōno told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday.Both Johnson and Hunt have said they would be prepared to take the UK out of the EU without an agreement if they become prime minister. Kōno said he had asked both of them to avoid a no-deal Brexit.“Whenever we had a meeting that was one of the major issue[s], ‘please no no deal. No no-deal Brexit’,” he said. “Whatever they do is up to the UK government, but we just don’t want to have a negative impact on the foreign companies in the United Kingdom, including the Japanese.”Kōno said he was particularly worried about the implications of a no-deal Brexit for Japanese carmakers in the UK.Speaking as Theresa May is due to visit Japan for the G20 summit in Osaka on Friday and Saturday, he said: “There are a few Japanese auto manufacturers operating in the United Kingdom and some parts are coming from continental Europe, and right now they have very smooth operations.“Their stock for each part is only for a few hours, but if there is [a] no-deal Brexit and if they have to go through actual custom[s] inspection, physically, those operations may not be able to continue. And many companies are worried about [the] implications, because they don’t know what’s going to happen.“Some companies have already start[ed] moving their operation[s] to other place[s] in Europe, so we do not want disrupt [the] economic relationship with the UK. So we have been asking the UK government [to] let the Japanese companies know what they can expect and [that] things should happen smoothly without any disruption.”Kōno said he knew both the former and the current foreign secretaries very well and revealed he had a signed copy of Johnson’s book about Winston Churchill and was impressed with Hunt’s ability to speak Japanese.But he urged them to take care of Japan’s companies operating in the UK when one of them becomes prime minister, warning Japanese investment was in jeopardy.Asked about the prospect of a bilateral free-trade agreement with the UK, Kōno said any negotiations would have to wait until after the UK leaves the EU. “You have to leave the EU first to be able to negotiate, so it would take some time. There [is] going to be some kind of gap between when the UK leaves the EU and when we can ratify [a] new trade deal.”",Japan says next British PM must not lead UK out of EU without deal,2019-06-27/09:31:36,japan s foreign minister has pleaded with boris johnson and jeremy hunt not to lead the uk out of the eu without a deal when one of them becomes prime minister in an unusually blunt warning tarō kōno suggested japanese companies operating in the uk would relocate to other countries in europe in the event of a no deal brexit there are over   japanese companies operating in the united kingdom so we are very concerned with this no deal brexit kōno told bbc radio  s today programme on thursday both johnson and hunt have said they would be prepared to take the uk out of the eu without an agreement if they become prime minister kōno said he had asked both of them to avoid a no deal brexit whenever we had a meeting that was one of the major issue s please no no deal no no deal brexit he said whatever they do is up to the uk government but we just don t want to have a negative impact on the foreign companies in the united kingdom including the japanese kōno said he was particularly worried about the implications of a no deal brexit for japanese carmakers in the uk speaking as theresa may is due to visit japan for the g summit in osaka on friday and saturday he said there are a few japanese auto manufacturers operating in the united kingdom and some parts are coming from continental europe and right now they have very smooth operations their stock for each part is only for a few hours but if there is a no deal brexit and if they have to go through actual custom s inspection physically those operations may not be able to continue and many companies are worried about the implications because they don t know what s going to happen some companies have already start ed moving their operation s to other place s in europe so we do not want disrupt the economic relationship with the uk so we have been asking the uk government to let the japanese companies know what they can expect and that things should happen smoothly without any disruption kōno said he knew both the former and the current foreign secretaries very well and revealed he had a signed copy of johnson s book about winston churchill and was impressed with hunt s ability to speak japanese but he urged them to take care of japan s companies operating in the uk when one of them becomes prime minister warning japanese investment was in jeopardy asked about the prospect of a bilateral free trade agreement with the uk kōno said any negotiations would have to wait until after the uk leaves the eu you have to leave the eu first to be able to negotiate so it would take some time there is going to be some kind of gap between when the uk leaves the eu and when we can ratify a new trade deal ,Brexit,0.24218139052391052
9456,"Germany will fight to the last hour to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal and is willing to hear any fresh ideas for the Irish border backstop, the country’s ambassador to the UK has said.Speaking at a car manufacturers’ summit in London, Peter Wittig said Germany cherished its relationship with the UK and was ready to talk about solutions the new prime minister might have for the Irish border problem.“My country is ready to talk and the chancellor [Angela Merkel] once said she would be willing to talk to the last hour not to have a no-deal scenario,” he said.“It’s a mindset. We are not giving up in achieving an orderly Brexit. Germany has been a very pragmatic voice in this whole tortuous Brexit process and we will continue to be that.“Even if we have a short window while the new prime minister is in place, we will welcome any idea how to solve that famous backstop issue and we will be willing to work towards a negotiated deal which is long term the only viable and sensible option for Europe,” he added.Asked if Germany would support another extension in the Brexit process, he said: “We can’t be more specific. It is now the turn of the UK government to come up with the plan and talk to us [the EU].“Our mindset is to explore all pathways to come to a negotiated deal.”The German envoy’s comments came as motor industry leaders warned that the cost of car manufacturing would go up £70m a day if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, making the British automotive industry more vulnerable to closures,.They also warned for the second time this year that car prices will go up by an average of £1,500.“Leaving the EU without a deal would trigger the most seismic shift in trading conditions ever experienced by automotive, with billions of pounds of tariffs threatening to impact consumer choice and affordability,” said the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) at an industry conference in London.“The end to borderless trade could bring crippling disruptions to the industry’s just-in-time operating model. Delays to shipments of parts to production plants are measured in minutes, with every 60 seconds costing £50,000 in gross value added – amounting to some £70m a day in a worst-case scenario,” it added.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn divorce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Martin BelamIn a report, the SMMT said the imposition of tariffs for trade in passenger cars along would be £4.5bn, a “knockout blow” to the sector’s competitiveness.The industry has already lost two big names in the past year with the closure of Honda in Swindon in 2021 and the axing of the Ford plant in Bridgend in Wales with the loss of thousands of jobs.While neither Honda nor Ford cited Brexit as a cause, the industry fears Britain’s competitiveness and unstable political environment will deter future investment by global car manufacturers.Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: “We are already seeing investment stall. As a manufacturer you constantly invest in machinery to make sure you are more efficient, make sure you are competitive.“When the big investment decisions come with a new model, that’s when you are competing with other plants, that’s when you need to be at your most efficient and if in the previous two or three years you have underinvested it makes it much harder.”Few car companies want to go public on their fears over Brexit because of the backlash in the media and some political interests, sources say.Hawes said the analysis of tariffs was based on facts, on industry and government data and warned that his pleas were not fearmongering.“We are not making claims that the entire industry will close doors overnight, this industry is adaptable and agile, but it can only do so much if the barriers are particularly high,” he said.He warned the industry would decline with a “death by a thousand cuts”.Costs could be hit by stoppages in production lines in the event of delays to supply of components over the Calais-Dover transit route and also by the imposition of tariffs of between 2% and 4.5% by the EU.The car industry has little to no warehousing capacity to stockpile in the event of no deal with production based on just-in-time and just-in-sequence systems.“We have 1,100 vehicles a day coming into the UK with parts, components, we need them to move seamlessly. If we have delivery delays, that means production stops,” he said.Some component manufacturers have also been hit by the Brexit uncertainty, Hawes said, including one company in south Wales.",Germany ‘will talk to the last hour’ to avoid no-deal Brexit,2019-06-25/13:55:11,germany will fight to the last hour to prevent the uk crashing out of the eu without a deal and is willing to hear any fresh ideas for the irish border backstop the country s ambassador to the uk has said speaking at a car manufacturers summit in london peter wittig said germany cherished its relationship with the uk and was ready to talk about solutions the new prime minister might have for the irish border problem my country is ready to talk and the chancellor angela merkel once said she would be willing to talk to the last hour not to have a no deal scenario he said it s a mindset we are not giving up in achieving an orderly brexit germany has been a very pragmatic voice in this whole tortuous brexit process and we will continue to be that even if we have a short window while the new prime minister is in place we will welcome any idea how to solve that famous backstop issue and we will be willing to work towards a negotiated deal which is long term the only viable and sensible option for europe he added asked if germany would support another extension in the brexit process he said we can t be more specific it is now the turn of the uk government to come up with the plan and talk to us the eu our mindset is to explore all pathways to come to a negotiated deal the german envoy s comments came as motor industry leaders warned that the cost of car manufacturing would go up m a day if the uk leaves the eu without a deal making the british automotive industry more vulnerable to closures they also warned for the second time this year that car prices will go up by an average of   leaving the eu without a deal would trigger the most seismic shift in trading conditions ever experienced by automotive with billions of pounds of tariffs threatening to impact consumer choice and affordability said the society of motor manufacturers and traders smmt at an industry conference in london the end to borderless trade could bring crippling disruptions to the industry s just in time operating model delays to shipments of parts to production plants are measured in minutes with every  seconds costing   in gross value added amounting to some m a day in a worst case scenario it added at pm uk time on  october the uk would by default become a third country in terms of relations with the eu with no overarching post brexit plan in place and no transition period the uk would no longer be paying into the eu budget nor would it hand over the bn divorce payment the uk would drop out of countless arrangements pacts and treaties covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people foodstuffs other goods and data to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation and policing and security without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed in the immediate aftermath without a deal the uk would trade with the eu on the default terms of the world trade organization wto including tariffs on agricultural goods the uk government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country this would lower the price of imports making it harder for british manufacturers to compete with foreign goods if the uk sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the eu under wto most favoured nation rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries wto rules only cover goods they do not apply to financial services a significant part of the uk s economy trading under wto rules will also require border checks which could cause delays at ports and a severe challenge to the peace process in ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border some no deal supporters have claimed that the uk can use article  of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt to force the eu to accept a period of up to  years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated however the uk cannot invoke article  unilaterally the eu would have to agree to it in previous cases where the article has been used the two sides had a deal in place and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the eu and the uk s trading relationship the director general of the wto roberto azevêdo has told prospect magazine that in simple factual terms in this scenario you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the uk and eu where currently there are none until some agreements are in place a no deal scenario will place extra overheads on uk businesses eg the current government advice is that all drivers including lorries and commercial vehicles will require extra documentation to be able to drive in europe after  october if there is no deal those arguing for a managed no deal envisage that a range of smaller sector by sector bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self interest between the uk and eu to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy martin belamin a report the smmt said the imposition of tariffs for trade in passenger cars along would be  bn a knockout blow to the sector s competitiveness the industry has already lost two big names in the past year with the closure of honda in swindon in  and the axing of the ford plant in bridgend in wales with the loss of thousands of jobs while neither honda nor ford cited brexit as a cause the industry fears britain s competitiveness and unstable political environment will deter future investment by global car manufacturers mike hawes the smmt chief executive said we are already seeing investment stall as a manufacturer you constantly invest in machinery to make sure you are more efficient make sure you are competitive when the big investment decisions come with a new model that s when you are competing with other plants that s when you need to be at your most efficient and if in the previous two or three years you have underinvested it makes it much harder few car companies want to go public on their fears over brexit because of the backlash in the media and some political interests sources say hawes said the analysis of tariffs was based on facts on industry and government data and warned that his pleas were not fearmongering we are not making claims that the entire industry will close

9471,"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, doing its best to make sense of all this nonsense since June 2016. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And you can catch our monthly Brexit Means … podcast here.In case you’ve been residing temporarily on another planet, the former and current foreign secretaries, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, made it through to the final runoff round of the Conservative leadership contest.Almost instantly, Johnson became embroiled in a row over a late-night altercation with his girlfriend that was loud and worrying enough for a neighbour to call the police – but not for the the potential future PM to answer any questions about.Johnson came under increasing pressure to explain the row not just from Hunt, who accused the former London mayor of trying to “slink through the back door” of No 10 by “pathetically” evading questioning, but other ministers and a major Tory donor. Hunt later upped the ante as Johnson refused to appear on a Sky debate.Johnson’s Brexit plans – including a no-deal exit “if necessary” on 31 October, with article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade ensuring there would be no tariffs on UK exports to the EU – were also criticised as pie in the sky by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox.Despite all the above, however, polls found that the former London mayor – although his popularity took a substantial hit – was still seen by Conservative members (his immediate electorate) as more trusted to make big decisions and negotiate with the EU, and more competent, than his rival.At an EU summit in Brussels, meanwhile, the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, said Johnson might make the Brexit process “even more exciting”, but the withdrawal agreement had been sealed and would not change.EU leaders now think Britain will crash out of the EU on 31 October unless the deal is ratified or the new PM calls a second referendum or election this summer. Britain’s former envoy to the EU, Ivan Rogers, said the country was being led to no deal by a political elite who had “great difficulties discerning and telling the truth”.Should an early election (see below) end up being called, the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, went on the record as saying he would be interested in local coalition pacts with the Conservatives to help ensure the UK left the EU without a deal.At the other end of the political spectrum, Hilary Benn called Brexit a “complete and utter mess” and demanded that Labour unambiguously back a second referendum, while Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said the party would have to back remain to survive.More and more people think early elections are likely after the new prime minister engages unsuccessfully with EU capitals and Michel Barnier’s team to obtain the changes to the Irish backstop he thinks might get the deal through parliament (none exist, as this piece makes clear).Several MPs have “huge concerns” about whether Johnson or Hunt could command the confidence of the Commons and avoid an autumn election, and the junior defence minister Tobias Ellwood said up to a dozen Conservative MPs could support a no-confidence motion against the new government.Johnson could also decide to trigger an election himself with the backing of two-thirds of MPs, but would be unlikely to be able to organise it before the 31 October Brexit deadline without an extension, which he will not want to ask for.That makes a no-deal exit more likely, many analysts believe. But so too, if there is an election, could be a new Tory government backed by the Brexit party – or a pro-remain Labour government backed by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP.UK finances forecast to suffer under most forms of Brexit.Brexit: alternative to Irish backstop “feasible in three years”.Brexit viewed with incredulity overseas, says ambassador.Ease migration rules for Indians to win post-Brexit deals, say MPs.Vital medicine supplies at risk if UK crashes out of EU, MPs warned.Barclay and Barnier clash on citizens’ rights under no-deal Brexit.In the Guardian, Anand Menon and Alan Wager say the contest between Johnson and Hunt is really about who can win a looming general election:None of the Brexit tales being told by the candidates bears any relationship to the real world. Each candidate will immediately confront two sobering realities: their demands aren’t negotiable, and they have to get something through a hung parliament with no majority for anything. An internal mandate from the Tory party may be all that’s needed to grab the keys to No 10. But actually doing something once in there requires a very different sort of mandate – one that can change the numbers of the House of Commons. This, remember, is a parliament which has the numbers to block a deal and also block no deal. To support solutions the EU will never countenance and to reject a referendum. Which is why what the candidates say does not really matter. How they solve the parliamentary conundrum does. So it’s down to Johnson and Hunt, and as their plans unfold one thing will become increasingly clear: those same Tory members are not really voting for someone to fix Brexit. They are voting for someone who might win the election that will be necessary for Brexit to be fixed.Might Brexit – or at any rate, Boris Johnson as PM – mean the end of the union?UK (Scotland),

9501,"The question, set less by Brussels than the logic of Brexit, is how the UK government can in one move leave the European union’s single market and customs while also maintaining the flow of trade and people on its one land border with the bloc in IrelandThe fact that the existence of the land border in question cost more than 3,600 lives over 30 years led to the British government in December 2017 restating its commitment to avoid “a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls”.Avoiding a backdoor for smugglers into the single market is additionally regarded as essential by Dublin and the European commission, as is avoiding crippling extra bureaucracy on Irish businesses.The so-called Irish backstop in the 585-page withdrawal agreement – to remain in place “unless and until” an alternative solution for keeping the border open is found – offers one solution by doing two key things.First, Northern Ireland stays within the EU’s regulatory regime, and under direct jurisdiction of the European court of justice, so as to allow a single market for goods on the island of Ireland.Second, the whole of the UK shares a customs territory with the EU to avoid any checks on goods both between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.But rejected three times by the Commons on the grounds that the UK could be tied into the backstop indefinitely, leaving the government unable to sign its own comprehensive trade deals, the withdrawal agreement is said by Boris Johnson, still the frontrunner in the Tory leadership battle, to be “defunct”.What is the alternative? In recent days, Johnson has suggested that the EU and UK could give themselves more time to work on the problem by relying on “Gatt 24 or whatever it happens to be” to provide for a “standstill in our current arrangements”.Under article XXIV of the general agreement on tariffs and trade, tariffs would remain at zero even under a no-deal exit on 31 October for up to a decade, it is said. The agreement could additionally leave the Irish border open while the two sides sought a new accommodation.The problem for Johnson, in the words of the trade secretary, Liam Fox, is that this “isn’t true”. Article XXIV is only relevant if there is an an agreement in principle on a free trade deal. It gives the two parties time to turn an interim deal into a final one.But the EU has said that the first and necessary step towards a trade deal is ratification of the withdrawal agreement. And the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said that without a legally binding guarantee that a hard border will not reemerge there will be no withdrawal agreement.In the light of this, interest has been aroused in a 201-page report published on Monday by a non-government organisation calling itself the Alternative Arrangements Commission.Backed by two former ministers, Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands, it has suggested that by 2022 a solution could be in place using a mix of technology, trusted trade schemes, mobile checks on food and animals within a new joint Irish-British Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) zone, special economic zones to push customs checks away from the border and a certain amount of looking the other way.The problems with it are legion. By imposing checks within a newly delineated border zone it fails the central task of avoiding new checks, and creates targets for terrorists in the new mobile veterinary vans. The burden of Brexit is put on Irish businesses. The exemptions on checks for many crossing the border will set off alarm bells for those concerned about the integrity of the single market.But the central problem for Brussels is that the plan is theoretical.There remains no certainty at all that the complicated IT systems, democratic consultation on the creation of new economic zones or negotiations with the European commission on the finer detail would be finalised by the end of the transition period of “standstill” relations.The Irish backstop would then have to remain to guarantee the avoidance of a hard border.

9922,"Have MPs missed their last chance to block a no-deal Brexit?Not quite. Labour seized the opportunity for action on Wednesday because they had been allotted an opposition day debate – an opportunity to decide what MPs discuss and vote on.They may not get another such day in this parliamentary session; and without that, or any looming legislation they can try to amend, there may be few parliamentary moments when concerned MPs can try to bind the hands of the next prime minister.Does the result mean there’s now no majority against a no-deal Brexit?It was certainly a relatively comfortable victory for the government: a majority of 11, compared with its defeat on the Cooper-Letwin bill, which passed by one vote in April.But Labour conceded even before the vote that it is always harder to persuade Conservative MPs to back a motion tabled in the name of Jeremy Corbyn, as this one was, rather than a backbench-led initiative.And the timing, in the middle of the Tory leadership contest, was also tricky. Many Conservative MPs may have felt any new leader deserves the opportunity to try to pursue their own Brexit plan first, before parliament starts trying to tie their hands.Could we still leave the EU with a deal?Yes – and Boris Johnson, the leading candidate to be Britain’s next prime minister, has said that’s his aim. He has declined to say what he will do if he is unable to secure the concessions he plans to demand from Brussels – but has insisted we must leave on 31 October, with or without a deal.So how could no deal be stopped?It looks as though the only remaining option is likely to be the most explosive one – bringing down the government.The Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve made clear in the course of the debate that he would be prepared to vote against his party in a no-confidence motion, if a future prime minister were to try to take Britain out of the EU without a deal.“If we get to a point where a prime minister is intent on doing this [taking the UK out of the EU without a deal], the only way of stopping that prime minister would be to bring down that prime minister’s government. And I simply have to say here and now I will not hesitate to do that if that is what is attempted, even if it means my resigning the whip and leaving the party,” he said.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has hinted he might also be prepared to do the same thing.With the Conservatives’ majority wafer-thin, Grieve and Hammond would not need to be joined by many others to bring down the government.Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, if a government loses a no-confidence vote, alternative leaders have a fortnight to try to assemble a parliamentary majority – and if they are unable to do so, a general election must be called.

9943,"A no-deal Brexit will create severe problems for Northern Irish businesses and oblige the Republic of Ireland to build border inspection posts, a report has said.Firms will have “limited room for manoeuvre” as they face an array of export checks, inspections and declarations, according to the report, which was commissioned by Northern Ireland’s Department for the Economy and published this week.It was a sobering reflection on the challenges if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, according to its authors, Eric Pickett and Michael Lux, lawyers who specialise in EU and international customs law.“In particular, it confirms the Northern Ireland civil service’s concern about the impact of EU tariffs on food exports to Ireland, and the ability of micro and small enterprises with no experience in customs procedures and operations to continue to export to Ireland,” said a cover note. More than 80% of small Northern Irish exporters trade only with the republic.The study said Ireland would need to establish inspection posts close to Northern Ireland to monitor trade in animal and food products, raising the spectre of a hard border that has prompted alarm from politicians and police chiefs who worry about attacks by dissident republicans.The report said use of technology such as electronic monitoring could be expanded but would not obviate the need for physical inspections. It also said the UK and EU could seek an exemption from World Trade Organization rules requiring tariffs and checks, but that it would probably be temporary.The EU has strict rules for checking animals and food products at border inspection posts (BIPS) near the point of entry. Ireland’s existing posts at Dublin airport, Dublin port and Shannon airport are more than 60 miles from the border. “Consequently, Ireland will have to establish BIPS which are closer to the border,” said the report.The findings were a blunt reminder that there is no easy fix to the Irish border conundrum that has bedevilled the UK’s attempt to leave the EU and presented a dilemma for the Conservative party leadership candidates vying to replace Theresa May.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn divorce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Martin BelamThe report noted that Switzerland and European Economic Area countries have derogation from inspection rules but that is because they have a deal with the EU. “The problem is that under a no-deal scenario, this option is not available.”Boris Johnson, Andrea Leadsom, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey have vowed that if they win the Tory leadership they will take the UK out of the EU on 31 October regardless of whether or not a deal is in place.This week’s report follows a series of other warnings about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Northern Ireland. David Sterling, the head of its civil service, wrote to local political parties in March saying it could undermine security and worsen unemployment.The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Tuesday that it would be a “terrible political miscalculation” for anyone in London to think that a new prime minister would prompt the EU to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. “That is really to misunderstand how the EU works.” May, he added, was not a bad negotiator and had obtained the best deal possible for the UK.",Northern Ireland businesses warned over no-deal Brexit,2019-06-12/13:22:49,a no deal brexit

10004,"The EU has been on a Brexit break since the UK secured a six-month delay to its departure. With Theresa May soon to leave 10 Downing Street, Brussels is tuning in to the Westminster drama of the Tory leadership race – with both amazement and exasperation.“People in Brussels are fed up that the political class in the UK has gone a little bit crazy,” Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the European council’s legal service said. British politicians seemed to have gone “on holiday”, since gaining the extension, he added.For the EU, the bookies’ favourite Boris Johnson, is a Trumpian figure whose disputed claims and bombastic rhetoric played a major role in plunging the UK into what is seen in Brussels as the Brexit nightmare.The former foreign secretary is remembered for his early 1990s stint as Brussels correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, where he made his name mocking EU regulations, promoting what the European commission calls “Euromyths”. He achieved wider prominence for his claims during the EU referendum campaign. “He lied a lot to the British people,” the then French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said in 2016.“The idea of Boris Johnson in the European council is probably quite abhorrent to some EU leaders,” an EU source said. “Boris is known in foreign policy circles, certainly not respected. He’s also seen as part of a wider Trump world and no one wants that.”The EU’s most senior civil servant, Martin Selmayr, once described a Johnson premiership as a “horror scenario”, classing him with Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump.#G7 2017 with Trump, Le Pen, Boris Johnson, Beppe Grillo? A horror scenario that shows well why it is worth fighting populism. #withJunckerMany EU insiders think the chances of no deal have increased, with the Tory party expected to choose a Brexiter prime minister.“For me it is very clear the odds of no-deal Brexit are more than half and clearly if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister the odds will go up again,” said Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian MEP and member of the European parliament’s Brexit steering group.Another favourite, Dominic Raab, is held in low-esteem in Brussels. During his four-month tenure as Brexit secretary, he lost trust of his EU counterparts. “He was seen to be working against his prime minister and making things up,” the first EU source said.The European commission recently accused Raab of making “fraudulent” claims and spreading “pure disinformation” in a campaign video about the views of its secretary-general, Selmayr, on the future of Ireland.Responding to unfavourable reports from Brussels, Raab told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show that it “probably tells you that I was doing my job in terms of pressing them hard and making sure that Britain’s interests were resolutely defended”.Candidates deemed compromise choices at Westminster have also inspired mistrust in Brussels. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is reported to have struck a different tone on Brexit with his EU counterparts than the public stance he takes in the UK. “He gave a very different impression than what he is suggesting now,” an EU diplomat said. More recently, Hunt has toned down his views on no deal, warning it would be “political suicide”.EU officials expect Tory candidates will be falling over themselves to prove their hard-Brexit credentials, following the party’s poor showing in the European elections, where just four of its MEPs were elected and Nigel Farage’s Brexit party won the most votes. “The Tory party will be in survival mode and … will have to regain credibility as the party of Brexit,” another EU source said.His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt’s attempts to talk up a backstory as an 'underestimated' entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse.Overall, Hunt’s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the 'Theresa in trousers' nickname among some Tory MPs – one that is more catchy than accurate (since May herself often wears trousers).In the final round of MP voting Hunt edged out Michael Gove, 77 votes to 75.Johnson’s progress to Downing Street appeared unstoppable even before an overwhelming victory in the first round of voting among MPs. Most of his colleagues believe it is now all but inevitable that he will be Britain’s next prime minister.His well-disciplined campaign team will continue with their strategy of subjecting him to minimal media exposure, though once the field is narrowed down to two, the final pair will appear in more than a dozen head-to-head hustings for Tory members. The team’s main aim is simply to keep heads down and avoid Johnson creating headlines for the wrong reasons. It may not have worked. Johnson came first in the final round of MP voting with 160 votes.For many, the leadership race is an unedifying fight for power, while the clock ticks down remorselessly to Brexit day on 31 October.More governments are coming round to the tough position of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who argued against a long extension on the grounds that Brexit would become a damaging and distracting burden for the EU.Donald Tusk, the European council president, helped persuade member states to back a longer extension, which he urged the UK not to waste.“We were definitely on the other side of Macron,” the diplomat recalled. “Now I think Macron was right. We were wrong. Tusk was wrong.”“[Macron] closed the door [to another extension] and it’s not shut, but the wind is blowing against it. And the harder Johnson’s rhetoric, and harder Raab’s rhetoric, the harder it is to open the door.”Asked about the Tory contest last month, Tusk said there was “nothing promising” in “the state of affairs in London”.Many in the EU would support an extension for what is known in Brussels as “a democratic event”, meaning a general election or a second referendum.Without that, Piris thinks EU leaders could say no to a further extension. “But even if they say yes. What would happen? There is an inability to solve this question in the House of Commons.”He stresses the Brexit conundrum is not down to an individual Tory leader. “It is a question of the political system of the UK being unable to answer to such a unique event in the life of the nation.”Lamberts warns that nothing will change for May’s successor, as the EU will refuse to reopen the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop. “Anyone who steps into Downing Street will face exactly the same constraints. Saying you want to renegotiate this agreement is nice and well, but it won’t happen,” he said.Meanwhile, the Tory contest is not keeping Brussels on the edge of its seat. “We really don’t care very much [who wins]” the diplomat said. “From an EU point of view, we would rather see someone that could deliver a smooth, orderly Brexit. Whether Johnson is going to be able to deliver it, the UK is going to have to ask itself.”","EU view of Tory leadership candidates deeply critical, say sources",2019-06-11/06:00:23,the eu has been on

10097,"A pro-choice charity that for decades has helped thousands of Irish women access abortions in England is sending foreign nationals to the Netherlands due to tighter UK visa regulations and the effects of Brexit.The Abortion Support Network (ASN) said it was guiding immigrant women in Ireland towards Dutch abortion facilities because it was taking too long to obtain visas for English clinics.The London-based organisation also warned that even EU citizens living in the republic may have to travel to Holland for terminations after Brexit rather than crossing the Irish Sea.ASN saidit was focusing on helping women from Ireland who were more than 12 weeks into a crisis pregnancy – the new legal limit for terminations in Ireland, which was introduced after the historic 2018 referendum to introduce abortion into the state.One of ASN’s principal concerns is for immigrant women such as a young African girl who became pregnant after being raped by soldiers in a civil war and made her way to Ireland. In 2014, she was refused an abortion in Ireland and forced to go through with the pregnancy by caesarean section in an Irish hospital.Other examples include a refugee who was pregnant when she arrived in Ireland but was afraid to tell anyone until she was 17 weeks. She spoke no English and had little support from the few people she knew in Ireland. Despite efforts to help her, the client was unable to travel to get an abortion before she reached the legal limit in Amsterdam. So she was forced to continue her pregnancy because ASN could not get her a visa to the UK in time.Mara Clarke, ASN’s director, told the Guardian it had noticed that since the Brexit vote and the Irish abortion referendum it was getting harder to obtain visas for these women to travel from Ireland to Britain.“For the past two years we’ve been finding it more and more difficult for non-EU residents of Ireland to get visas into the UK. And bear in mind that a ‘non-EU resident’ can be defined as anyone from an asylum seeker to a student from South Africa.“We’ve found it easier for those people to go to clinics in Holland where they go to 22 weeks and five days.”Clarke said many of their cases dealing with non-Irish women needing abortions beyond 12 weeks had been dogged by visa delays.“We had one case where a client was turned down five months after applying for a visa into the UK. There was another case where the UK part of the visa was approved a day and a half before the Irish part expired, so we had to pull in favours to get the client an appointment in an English clinic as well as paying a premium for last-minute flights.”Clarke said that after consulting with organisations representing immigrants in Ireland ASN decided it would be easier to send clients to the Netherlands.“This means it is no longer possible for the woman to take the trip in one day but it’s better than nothing. I want to make clear that our only issue is with the UK visa process, not with the UK clinics,” Clarke said.She warned that when Britain finally leaves the EU this could have major implications, even for European citizens who live in the Irish Republic. Irish citizens will have a special right to travel to Britain unhindered under the Ireland-UK Common Travel Area agreement between the two states. However, this will not apply to other EU citizens.Explaining why Dutch clinics may be ASN clients’ best option after Brexit, Clarke said: “Any Brexit impact on travel – whether it is people needing a passport that is valid for a certain amount of time, or people needing visas or other travel documentation – will impact on people travelling for abortion. Even extra delays at airport security post-Brexit could mean people travelling from Ireland to England would be forced to stay overnight at clinics instead of coming in and out in one day.”Over the last five years, ASN has helped 681 women from Northern Ireland, 53 from the Isle of Man and 2,605 from the Irish Republic to have terminations at clinics in England. The group has given 975 clients £298,741 in financial support to pay for abortions in the same period in English clinics.The Irish Refugee Council (IRC) in Dublin said delays in treating non-Irish women who were in crisis pregnancies made it more likely they would have to travel abroad for an abortion.Nick Henderson, the IRC’s chief executive said: “In the experience of the Irish Refugee Council, particularly for a person who is the victim of sexual violence, it can be very difficult to disclose their experience and that they might be pregnant. This can cause a delay for people newly arriving in the jurisdiction and they may be well outside the 12 weeks before they seek help. With each delay it becomes more likely that a person seeking asylum will need to travel for an abortion.”",Brexit effect forces women to go to Netherlands for abortions,2019-06-07/15:57:02,a pro choice charity that for decades has helped thousands of irish women access abortions in england is sending foreign nationals to the netherlands due to tighter uk visa regulations and the effects of brexit the abortion support network asn said it was guiding immigrant women in ireland towards dutch abortion facilities because it was taking too long to obtain visas for english clinics the london based organisation also warned that even eu citizens living in the republic may have to travel to holland for terminations after brexit rather than crossing the irish sea asn saidit was focusing on helping women from ireland who were more than  weeks into a crisis pregnancy the new legal limit for terminations in ireland which was introduced after the historic  referendum to introduce abortion into the state one of asn s principal concerns is for immigrant women such as a young african girl who became pregnant after being raped by soldiers in a civil war and made her way to ireland in  she was refused an abortion in ireland and forced to go through with the pregnancy by caesarean section in an irish hospital other examples include a refugee who was pregnant when she arrived in ireland but was afraid to tell anyone until she was  weeks she spoke no english and had little support from the few people she knew in ireland despite efforts to help her the client was unable to travel to get an abortion before she reached the legal limit in amsterdam so she was forced to continue her pregnancy because asn could not get her a visa to the uk in time mara clarke asn s director told the guardian it had noticed that since the brexit vote and the irish abortion referendum it was getting harder to obtain visas for these women to travel from ireland to britain for the past two years we ve been finding it more and more difficult for non eu residents of ireland to get visas into the uk and bear in mind that a non eu resident can be defined as anyone from an asylum seeker to a student from south africa we ve found it easier for those people to go to clinics in holland where they go to  weeks and five days clarke said many of their cases dealing with non irish women needing abortions beyond  weeks had been dogged by visa delays we had one case where a client was turned down five months after applying for a visa into the uk there was another case where the uk part of the visa was approved a day and a half before the irish part expired so we had to pull in favours to get the client an appointment in an english clinic as well as paying a premium for last minute flights clarke said that after consulting with organisations representing immigrants in ireland asn decided it would be easier to send clients to the netherlands this means it is no longer possible for the woman to take the trip in one day but it s better than nothing i want to make clear that our only issue is with the uk visa process not with the uk clinics clarke said she warned that when britain finally leaves the eu this could have major implications even for european citizens who live in the irish republic irish citizens will have a special right to travel to britain unhindered under the ireland uk common travel area agreement between the two states however this will not apply to other eu citizens explaining why dutch clinics may be asn clients best option after brexit clarke said any brexit impact on travel whether it is people needing a passport that is valid for a certain amount of time or people needing visas or other travel documentation will impact on people travelling for abortion even extra delays at airport security post brexit could mean people travelling from ireland to england would be forced to stay overnight at clinics instead of coming in and out in one day over the last five years asn has helped  women from northern ireland  from the isle of man and   from the irish republic to have terminations at clinics in england the group has given  clients   in financial support to pay for abortions in the same period in english clinics the irish refugee council irc in dublin said delays in treating non irish women who were in crisis pregnancies made it more likely they would have to travel abroad for an abortion nick henderson the irc s chief executive said in the experience of the irish refugee council particularly for a person who is the victim of sexual violence it can be very difficult to disclose their experience and that they might be pregnant this can cause a delay for people newly arriving in the jurisdiction and they may be well outside the  weeks before they seek help with each delay it becomes more likely that a person seeking asylum will need to travel for an abortion ,Brexit,0.16587860882282257
10312,"Irish commentators have condemned Sajid Javid for describing Ireland as “the tail that wags the dog” on Brexit.The home secretary made the comments as he continued to expand on his Tory leadership pitch, setting out how his Brexit plan hinged on coming up with an alternative to the Irish backstop.“I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through parliament – that was the withdrawal agreement with a change to the backstop,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “[Ireland] is the tail that wags the dog on this and we need to make sure we can do more to build that goodwill in Ireland and build their confidence.”The comments were seen by many in Ireland as a diplomatic faux pas. “Using a term like that is very unfortunate and I would be appealing to representatives in the UK to be mindful of their rhetoric,” said Neale Richmond, a senator from the governing Fine Gael party who chairs the Irish parliament’s Brexit committee.“We saw that as well in December with [the Tory MP] Priti Patel talking about Britain preventing food imports to Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, in ignorance that we had a major famine here. It also feeds into the misconception that somehow Ireland and the EU are separate or we are taking order from masters. We are and have been unified in this process, even if that appears to have taken some people in the UK by surprise.”Richmond took issue with Javid’s call for the UK to “make a grand gesture to Ireland” by covering all of the costs of creating a “modern, digitised border” between the two countries.“It’s not about cost. It’s about upholding the legal responsibility as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday agreement by maintaining a seamless border. No realistic digital or technological solutions have been proposed,” Richmond said.He also criticised another Tory leadership contender, Andrea Leadsom, for describing her Brexit plan as a “managed exit”.Other commentators also criticised Javid’s comments. “Sajid seems to be proposing a reverse Trump: we are not going to build a wall and Ireland’s not going to pay for it … Hmm,” tweeted Matthew O’Toole, a former civil servant who worked at No 10 under David Cameron.",Sajid Javid criticised for calling Ireland 'tail that wags the dog' on Brexit,2019-06-02/17:06:32,irish commentators have condemned sajid javid for describing ireland as the tail that wags the dog on brexit the home secretary made the comments as he continued to expand on his tory leadership pitch setting out how his brexit plan hinged on coming up with an alternative to the irish backstop i will focus on the one brexit deal that has already got through parliament that was the withdrawal agreement with a change to the backstop he told the bbc s andrew marr show ireland is the tail that wags the dog on this and we need to make sure we can do more to build that goodwill in ireland and build their confidence the comments were seen by many in ireland as a diplomatic faux pas using a term like that is very unfortunate and i would be appealing to representatives in the uk to be mindful of their rhetoric said neale richmond a senator from the governing fine gael party who chairs the irish parliament s brexit committee we saw that as well in december with the tory mp priti patel talking about britain preventing food imports to ireland in the event of a no deal brexit in ignorance that we had a major famine here it also feeds into the misconception that somehow ireland and the eu are separate or we are taking order from masters we are and have been unified in this process even if that appears to have taken some people in the uk by surprise richmond took issue with javid s call for the uk to make a grand gesture to ireland by covering all of the costs of creating a modern digitised border between the two countries it s not about cost it s about upholding the legal responsibility as a co guarantor of the good friday agreement by maintaining a seamless border no realistic digital or technological solutions have been proposed richmond said he also criticised another tory leadership contender andrea leadsom for describing her brexit plan as a managed exit other commentators also criticised javid s comments sajid seems to be proposing a reverse trump we are not going to build a wall and ireland s not going to pay for it hmm tweeted matthew o toole a former civil servant who worked at no  under david cameron ,Brexit,0.22345516085624695
10523,"The European elections were meaningless. They can be read any way we want. Brexit won, but with a third of the vote, against anti-Brexit parties with much the same. Stir in a third of “others”, including Tories, Labour and nationalists, and soon all we get is noise. Britain still has a Tory government and a Labour opposition, both broken-backed. The vote was not for any ruling party. Just forget it.Meanwhile, still lying steaming on the Commons floor are three monster turds, all with a 31 October sell-by date. One is a Brexit crash-out no deal. Another is a second referendum, possibly revoking Brexit. A third, stinking to high heaven, is Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement.In the absence of any action, crashing out is now the legal default position. Even as a life-long Eurosceptic, I have seen nothing suggesting this would be remotely in the nation’s interest. The idea that crashing out “on WTO terms” will somehow win centrists or moderate Tories back to the fold is absurd. It would split the party in parliament and alienate a centre ground already toxic for Tories. Renegotiation is impossible, as there is no Brussels to negotiate with until the autumn, let alone one with the will to budge.On the other hand a revocation referendum would be near impossible to get through parliament against a Tory government veto – short of some sort of Commons putsch. It would probably require a no-confidence vote and an election, which was hardly takes matters forward. A referendum, to be of any value, would be after, not before, a deal. This leaves May’s agreement. It is still on the table. It was never a final, only a transitional deal, but it was composed from the most rare and febrile Westminster substance, cross-party compromise. Remainers hated it as against their faith. Some Tories hated it because they were flat-earthers, others because they loathed May and wanted her job.What has changed is the certainty of a new Tory prime minister. May’s sole legacy to them was her deal. It offered the country a perfectly honourable way forward out of the EU and into a new relationship with Europe. Any fool could pick holes in it, but it was a compromise agreed by Brussels, and would see us out before the 31 October deadline.A new Tory leader can only start from there. Towering ahead is one of the greatest peacetime tasks to face any British leader, to pull a shattered parliament back from the brink. It means swallowing all bombast and pride and taking forward a compromise based on May’s deal. There is no alternative.• Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",The EU election changes nothing.

10587,"Now that Theresa May has announced her resignation date, what happens next?Initially nothing. She will remain in post to bear the burden of the European election results, which will be announced on Sunday night and are widely expected to be grim for the Tory party.She will also greet Donald Trump when he visits and stand alongside the US president and other world leaders for the D-day commemorations in Portsmouth on 5 June.The jostling among potential successors that has already been going on for weeks will intensify dramatically. The contest officially begins on 10 June, when candidates will be asked to declare themselves formally. MPs will then whittle them down in a series of votes by the end of June, leaving party members to make the final choice.The party is aiming for the process to be complete by mid-July, in time for a new prime minister to take over before parliament’s summer break.What does May’s departure mean for Brexit?The main reason for the relatively quickfire contest is to give the new leader time to put a new cabinet in place and set out their stall on Brexit. Britain’s deadline for leaving the EU is 31 October, which leaves little time for discussions with EU27 leaders.Brexit is likely to dominate the leadership contest. Candidates will have to compete to show their stance is tough enough to impress the leave-leaning Conservative membership and see off the threat from Nigel Farage’s Brexit party.Boris Johnson, the frontrunner, has already said Britain must leave the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal, but he risks being outflanked on the right by Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary.The European Research Group’s Steve Baker, who voted against May’s withdrawal agreement all three times, unlike Johnson and Raab, has also said he is considering standing.Are we on the road to no deal?It certainly looks a lot more likely than it did at the start of the week. Champions of Johnson and Raab hope they might convince the EU27 to offer a much looser relationship, based around a Canada-style free-trade deal and, crucially, to ditch the backstop.Failing that, they could try to take Britain out without a deal. There has not been a majority for that approach in parliament, but the hard Brexiters believe a strong showing by Farage’s party will shift the balance. Certainly, backbenchers who masterminded the last parliamentary manoeuvres to block no deal, including Nick Boles and Yvette Cooper, doubt whether they would be able to do so again.If parliament did move against no deal, the new leader could call a general election, or even a referendum, in a bid to win a strong public mandate.Is Theresa May’s deal dead?Not completely. Much of the exit deal she negotiated, on issues such as citizens’ rights, the divorce bill and access to EU institutions, is likely to remain in place whatever comes next.She could even try to hold votes on some of its less contentious elements in her remaining few weeks in office, so that at least some of the legislative groundwork for leaving on time on 31 October is done.Many Brexiters, however, are determined to kill the backstop. May always insisted it simply formalised the UK’s obligations to protect the open border in Northern Ireland, but Johnson and others fear it will become the basis of the future trading relationship.The “Chequers deal”, May’s painstaking attempt to marry the needs of Britain’s economy with her Brexit red lines, looks like ancient history, though some observers believe Johnson might soften on Brexit somewhat once the leadership election is out of the way.Could Brexit still be stopped?Yes. A general election could return a Labour, or Labour-led government, but if Jeremy Corbyn’s party entered a coalition with the anti-Brexit Scottish National party or Liberal Democrats, it would come under intense pressure to call another Brexit referendum.With parliamentary and public debate becoming ever more polarised, there is also a growing chorus of calls for article 50 simply to be revoked. That looks impossible in the current parliament, but some ministers believe MPs would prefer it to no deal and a general election could change the complexion of the Commons dramatically – or, of course, leave it all but unchanged.","Deal or no deal: what next for Brexit, the Tories and the country?",2019-05-24/17:00:00,now that theresa may has announced her resignation date what happens next initially nothing she will remain in post to bear the burden of the european election results which will be announced on sunday night and are widely expected to be grim for the tory party she will also greet donald trump when he visits and stand alongside the us president and other world leaders for the d day commemorations in portsmouth on  june the jostling among potential successors that has already been going on for weeks will intensify dramatically the contest officially begins on  june when candidates will be asked to declare themselves formally mps will then whittle them down in a series of votes by the end of june leaving party members to make the final choice the party is aiming for the process to be complete by mid july in time for a new prime minister to take over before parliament s summer break what does may s departure mean for brexit the main reason for the relatively quickfire contest is to give the new leader time to put a new cabinet in place and set out their stall on brexit britain s deadline for leaving the eu is  october which leaves little time for discussions with eu leaders brexit is likely to dominate the leadership contest candidates will have to compete to show their stance is tough enough to impress the leave leaning conservative membership and see off the threat from nigel farage s brexit party boris johnson the frontrunner has already said britain must leave the eu on  october deal or no deal but he risks being outflanked on the right by dominic raab the former brexit secretary the european research group s steve baker who voted against may s withdrawal agreement all three times unlike johnson and raab has also said he is considering standing are we on the road to no deal it certainly looks a lot more likely than it did at the start of the week champions of johnson and raab hope they might convince the eu to offer a much looser relationship based around a canada style free trade deal and crucially to ditch the backstop failing that they could try to take britain out without a deal there has not been a majority for that approach in parliament but the hard brexiters believe a strong showing by farage s party will shift the balance certainly backbenchers who masterminded the last parliamentary manoeuvres to block no deal including nick boles and yvette cooper doubt whether they would be able to do so again if parliament did move against no deal the new leader could call a general election or even a referendum in a bid to win a strong public mandate is theresa may s deal dead not completely much of the exit deal she negotiated on issues such as citizens rights the divorce bill and access to eu institutions is likely to remain in place whatever comes next she could even try to hold votes on some of its less contentious elements in her remaining few weeks in office so that at least some of the legislative groundwork for leaving on time on  october is done many brexiters however are determined to kill the backstop may always insisted it simply formalised the uk s obligations to protect the open border in northern ireland but johnson and others fear it will become the basis of the future trading relationship the chequers deal may s painstaking attempt to marry the needs of britain s economy with her brexit red lines looks like ancient history though some observers believe johnson might soften on brexit somewhat once the leadership election is out of the way could brexit still be stopped yes a general election could return a labour or labour led government but if jeremy corbyn s party entered a coalition with the anti brexit scottish national party or liberal democrats it would come under intense pressure to call another brexit referendum with parliamentary and public debate becoming ever more polarised there is also a growing chorus of calls for article  simply to be revoked that looks impossible in the current parliament but some ministers believe mps would prefer it to no deal and a general election could change the complexion of the commons dramatically or of course leave it all but unchanged ,Brexit,0.2959578037261963
10675,"After the 2017 general election, when Theresa May’s majority evaporated, George Osborne – the chancellor whom she had brutally sacked – described her as a “dead woman walking”.In some ways, the miracle is how a prime minister, with something of a reverse Midas touch when it comes to politics, has kept walking for nearly two years since then. But with just days left of her prime-ministership, she was determined to outline one last big, bold offer on Brexit. Ignoring the requests of advisers and ministers to wait until after tomorrow’s European elections, she pressed ahead with a major speech.The speech had a serious argument. There’s a lot in it with which it is hard to disagree, including her admission that Brexit was more complicated than many had claimed, and would require compromise. Quite. The problem is that the prime minister herself had spent quite some time in office implying that everything was rather binary because Brexit just meant Brexit. Indeed, it was her early actions in office – for example, her stubborn refusal to guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the UK – that helped exacerbate the divisions of the referendum.Discussing the substance of yesterday’s speech is beside the point. The problem was the messenger, not the messageThere was a powerful logic to much of what May argued. But the speech stuck in the craw of many, especially the implication that the government would not just allow a vote on, but also would implement, a second referendum on Brexit.From my perspective, a further referendum in the absence of a clear electoral mandate for one would be a democratic outrage. I believe it would only further deepen divisions in this country over Brexit, would compound problems in Europe, and would give the SNP carte blanche to demand a rerun in Scotland. But I recognise that if a determined majority of MPs insist on one, it would politically be pretty much impossible to avoid without dissolving parliament. What the prime minister should have said yesterday was that there was no way she personally would ever lead a government to one.But discussing the substance of yesterday’s speech is somewhat beside the point. The problem was more about the messenger than the message. Many Conservative MPs are just not willing to listen to arguments from a party leader who they think has betrayed them. It’s hard to find a single Tory backbencher who thinks there’s any real way forward for the prime minister. Eurosceptic MPs who literally offered to build statues to honour her now publicly demand her resignation.Of course, the prime minister was not actually expecting to win the support of the remaining Conservative rebels. Although 90% of Tory MPs backed her Brexit deal on 29 March, including every single cabinet minister who resigned over Brexit, 34 Conservative MPs refused to do so. It seemed nigh on impossible to persuade 30 of them to switch position, which would allow her deal to pass. So, as one senior Downing Street figure put it to me, they were putting themselves “entirely” in “Labour’s hands”.Labour isn’t listening. Although we tend to focus on the Conservatives’ political crisis, Labour itself is bitterly split. John McDonnell wants a deal to cauterise the Brexit problem, whereas Keir Starmer and the powerful chief whip, Nick Brown, back a new referendum. Jeremy Corbyn isn’t powerful enough to move in either direction and so keeps sitting on the fence. Meanwhile, Labour haemorrhages votes to the Brexit party in one direction, and the Lib Dems in another.Although the prime minister’s speech included offers to various groups within parliament (including the bloc of Labour MPs opposed to a second referendum), none believe she has the political patronage or durability to cash the cheques she wrote just yesterday. As her credit dries up, there’s no incentive for any group to move to support this deal. It’s hard to see this as anything other than the endgame for her prime-ministership.Since the speech yesterday, a series of previously loyal Conservative MPs have declared against her Brexit plan. Support for her deal is going backwards. The withdrawal agreement bill (Wab)has not even been published yet, but barring a big change of position from a major group of MPs, it would be irresponsible to bring it forward. At this stage there seems zero prospect of a majority at second reading.A Conservative leadership contest is now imminent, with Brexit a running sore. With well over a dozen possible candidates, events could move extremely rapidly. At the core will be the question of how to find a Brexit policy that can succeed in this parliament where this prime minister has so spectacularly failed.Expect unicorn-chasing, a potential race to the bottom, and simple answers to complex problems. It is often repeated that all political careers end in failure, unless politicians leave on their own terms.

10721,"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, trying to make sense of the nonsensical since June 2016. If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And you can catch our monthly Brexit Means podcast here.Theresa May pledged to give MPs another chance to vote on her Brexit deal in the week beginning 3 June after an hour-long meeting with Jeremy Corbyn at which the Labour leader raised concerns about her ability to deliver on a cross-party deal.The prime minister had said her promise held good with or without Labour’s backing, but it will have to be the latter, plainly, because – as long expected – talks between the two parties on a compromise Brexit plan promptly collapsed.Each side blamed the other for the failure of the talks, with May saying the sticking point had been Labour’s division over a second referendum and the opposition insisting the government had been unwilling to compromise.After Conservative backbenchers forced May to set a timetable for her departure in the first week of June, Labour noted that her imminent demise meant there was no guarantee any promises would be kept by a successor, such as Boris Johnson.The prime minister will, however, ask her cabinet to sign off a package of Brexit concessions this week as she gears up for one last bid to win over parliament with what she called a “new, bold offer to MPs across the House of Commons”, hoping the Tories’ forecast drubbing at the hands of the Brexit party will focus minds.With Labour also heading for a trouncing, Corbyn defended the party’s confusing bid for both leavers and remainers, while Channel 4 infuriated Nigel Farage by alleging the Brexit party leader had been funded to the tune of £450,000 after the referendum by insurance tycoon Arron Banks.May has committed to giving MPs a vote on her key piece of Brexit legislation, the withdrawal agreement bill, possibly incorporating some of the “progress” made in talks with Labour on issues including workers’ rights and environmental standards, in the first week of June.She is discussing with ministers whether to hold more indicative parliamentary votes before then, with the idea that whatever emerges also be included in the bill. The previous two sets of indicative votes, however, instigated by backbenchers, produced no Brexit solution with a majority in parliament.At the same time, the government is reopening discussions with the Democratic Unionist party about how to reassure them the deal would not lead to a border in the Irish Sea, as well as speaking to Tory leavers with concerns about the Irish backstop.The general assumption, however, is that the deal will not pass and attention will soon shift to a Tory leadership election. This could take up much of the summer, with the odds narrowing on a hard-Brexit MP, such as Johnson, winning.Such a leader would want to draw up a new departure plan, take it to Brussels and maybe put it to MPs. But the parliamentary arithmetic will be the same, as will the EU27s position, so a general election could follow once the new prime minister reaches their own impasse.Britain has until 31 October to pass the legislation necessary to enact Brexit or come up with an alternative policy.Nigel Farage doused with milkshake in NewcastlePro- and anti-Brexit parties neck and neck in EU election, says pollMPs have a duty to pass May’s Brexit deal, says health secretaryElectoral commission to visit Brexit party HQ over funding concernsBrexit party’s funding must be investigated, says Gordon BrownRage, rapture and pure populism: on the road with Farage“Future of Britain is in Europe,” the Queen told Germany in 1988Michael Heseltine will vote Lib Dem in European elections, leading to his suspension by the ToriesDavid Cameron’s book to be published in SeptemberSterling heads for worst week of the year as Brexit talks collapseJean-Claude Juncker: I regret not challenging “£350m a week” claimsBrexit chaos hits Thomas Cook as losses mount to £1.5bnIn the Observer, Andrew Rawnsley says the middle ground no longer exists over Brexit – it’s all or nothing now:The collapse of these cross-party talks is of a piece with the narrative arc since the referendum in the summer of 2016. For nearly three years, the scope for compromise has steadily shrunk as opinion on both sides has become more radicalised. Advocates of Brexit who once said they’d be content to be out of the EU but stay within the single market have since transmogrified into adamantine no-dealers. Remainers who might once have settled for a halfway house will now accept nothing other than a second referendum. Everyone involved in the Tory-Labour talks knew that any kind of compromise would leave vast numbers of voters hugely unhappy: another factor dooming the effort to failure.

Bartolomeo was speaking a day after Vale reported a weaker-than-expected 15% third-quarter earnings gain as the company struggles to restore production lost after regulators demanded that it shut down a series of other dams for safety reasons. Still, Vale shares were up 2.7% in morning trading, with analysts citing the company’s strong cash flow in the period, which they said cut its debt to an 11-year low. Also during the conference call, Marcelo Spinelli, Vale’s director of ferrous metals, forecast 2020 growth in global iron ore demand of 2% to 3%, adding that he expects a 1% uptick in Chinese steel production.

75,"SCRANTON, Pa.   - Democratic U.S. presidential contender Joe Biden plans to tout his economic policy credentials and double down on his attacks on President Donald Trump in a speech on Wednesday in the electoral battleground state of Pennsylvania. Biden, who faces a two-front war against the largest Democratic field in history as well as Trump, will speak in Scranton, the Rust Belt town where he grew up, about “the middle class values that guide his vision,” his campaign said. The speech is scheduled for 10 a.m. (1400 GMT). Biden, a leading contender in the Democratic race to take on Trump in the November 2020 election, recommitted to raising the U.S. minimum wage to $15 an hour from the current $7.25, according to a statement released on Tuesday. “Donald Trump has had everything given to him and spent his entire life and presidency enriching himself,” said Biden. “As president, Trump has not only cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, but he has made it more difficult for low-income and middle class workers to get what they’ve earned.” Biden told donors at a fundraiser in Exeter, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday night that “instead of spending money on these ridiculous tax cuts for the super wealthy,” America could invest in curing cancer or Alzheimer’s disease. “Yet again Joe shows not just how out of touch he is with the American middle-class, but with reality,” Trump campaign spokeswoman Erin Perrine said in a statement. “Under the Trump Administration workers are thriving, unemployment has hit record lows, wages are rising and all while taxes have been cut across the board - benefiting ALL Americans.” Biden has spent much of the past several weeks attacking Trump for his foreign policy and the president’s allegations, offered without evidence, about the foreign business dealings of  Biden’s son Hunter. His focus is now turning to an economic record that Trump has touted, including unemployment rates that have fallen to multi-decade lows. Biden’s attack comes as U.S. economic growth slows, raising fears of a recession as the benefits of a 2017 tax cut fade and tariffs imposed on Chinese imports hurt American farmers and manufacturers. Democrats have unveiled a slew of economic proposals meant to invest in future generations and reverse wealth and income inequality. Their most aggressive policies include universal income guarantees and imposing federal taxes on wealth, not just income. Biden has sounded a similar tone on inequality - saying regularly in campaign events that “it’s time to reward work, not just wealth” - but has stopped short of supporting many of the more dramatic proposals in the Democratic field. He has also criticized his opponents, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, for not being specific about how they would implement the wealth tax they support or pay for their other proposals, including a Medicare for All plan based on the government-run health insurance program for Americans 65 and older. But Biden has yet to release his own full economic plan. He has said he would pay for a $750 billion investment in higher education by raising some inheritance taxes and limiting the tax credits available to higher-income workers. He has also said he would pay for an expansion of healthcare benefits by increasing taxes on high-income earners’ investment profits and raising the marginal tax rate on the highest earners back to 39.6% from 37%, to which it was lowered under the Republicans’ 2017 tax bill.

99,"DUBAI   - Wall Street’s heavy hitters are back in Saudi Arabia but the terms of engagement have changed. The CEOs of Citigroup (C.N) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), as well as the heads of fund managers BlackRock (BLK.N) and BlackStone (BX.N) will be among those gathering in Riyadh next week for a glitzy investment conference, an event not attended by top financiers last year after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  SoftBank (9984.T) founder and CEO Masayoshi Son will also attend the Oct 29-31 conference, two people familiar with the matter said, as the Japanese company seeks to raise funds for a second technology fund. The Saudi sovereign wealth fund contributed $40 billion to Softbank’s first technology fund.     But the buzz around the Future Investment Initiative (FII) has faded since the conference was first launched in 2017, when it was heralded as Davos in the desert, a nod to the annual gathering of world leaders and corporate bosses in the Swiss Alps. Then, Saudi Arabia was being feted for its investment opportunities and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was hailed as a force for change. Now, fallout from Khashoggi’s killing and the stop-start process towards the long-awaited stock market listing of state-run energy giant Saudi Aramco have shifted the mood. “It’s not seen as a must-do event like Davos,” said one banker at an international bank. The country has struggled to lure foreign investment to fund projects outside the oil sector, including manufacturing, meant to create millions of jobs for Saudis, as investors hesitate over the commercial viability of projects and Riyadh’s human rights record. Proceeds from Aramco’s initial public offering will boost the Saudi wealth fund’s ability to back domestic mega-projects including the $500 billion futuristic city NEOM, announced at FII in 2017. But there has been little progress on NEOM so far other than construction of royal palaces and an airport. A NEOM company spokesman said it continues to engage with a “wide range of potential foreign and local investors”. Saudi Arabia has managed to sign some multi-billion dollar deals last year at the conference, but it was Aramco that clinched most of them. “Signing commercial agreements is great for PR, but what Saudi Arabia really needs is for many of its national development initiatives to move from the conceptual stage to implementation with foreign, private-sector partners,” said Robert Mogielnicki, resident scholar at Washington-based Arab Gulf States Institute. Aramco’s IPO, for which Prince Mohammed is seeking a $2 trillion valuation, remains the biggest draw in Saudi Arabia for investors. The company was due to announce plans on Oct. 20 for an initial 1%-2% flotation on the Saudi stock market, a listing that could be the biggest ever depending on the valuation.  But this has been delayed. An adviser told participating banks that Aramco wanted to wait until its third-quarter results were published to bolster investor confidence following attacks on the company’s plants last month which halved Saudi Arabia’s crude output. Sources also told Reuters more time was needed to lock in cornerstone investors for the listing. The country’s privatization drive looks far from reaching a target of 35-40 billion riyals ($9.33 billion-$10.66 billion) in non-oil state revenues by 2020 based on deals so far. A spokesman for Saudi National Center for Privatization & PPP said five public-private partnership infrastructure deals were closed since last December that involve more than 13 billion riyals in new investment in the next two to three years. “The opportunities to date are largely in listed equities and direct investment, and the privatization or IPOs have been limited to the oil and gas sector,” said Richard Segal at Manulife Investment Management. Prince Mohammed has courted Silicon Valley with visits to companies including Facebook (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) in 2016 and 2018. He has not visited a Western capital since Khashoggi was killed. Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) were in talks in 2017 to set up a presence in Saudi Arabia, sources said at the time, but no deals have emerged.  Asked if they would attend next week’s conference, Facebook and Apple declined to comment. Google (GOOGL.O) and Amazon did not respond to a request to comment. The CEO of German conglomerate Siemens (SIEGn.DE) will not attend due to other commitments, a company spokesman said. South Korea’s Samsung will be represented by its CEO and will sign a memorandum of understanding with Saudi entertainment resort Qiddiya at the event, Qiddiya said. The White House, which has resisted pressure to punish Riyadh over human rights abuses citing its strategic importance, is sending its U.S. energy and treasury secretaries Rick Perry and Steven Mnuchin and senior adviser Jared Kushner. While last year’s event was dominated by leaders from Asian and Arab countries, next week’s gathering will include Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. David Malpass, the head of the World Bank - which did not attend last year - will also be there.     “FII may be an immediate reality check, but the real test of investor confidence in Saudi Arabia will involve a longer-term assessment of foreign direct investment trends, commercial regulations, and transparency measures,” Mogielnicki said.

140,"  - Uniper (UN01.DE) deliberately obstructed Fortum’s proposed purchase of a stake in the German utility by registering assets in Russia as strategic, Kommersant daily quoted Fortum (FORTUM.HE) CEO Pekka Lundmark as saying on Thursday. Uniper and Fortum have had a strained relationship since the Finnish state-owned company launched a takeover bid for the German group in 2017 which Uniper opposed. In October, state-controlled Finnish utility Fortum agreed to buy a stake of more than 20.5% in Uniper, which would bring its total holding to more than 70.5%. But the purchase is subject to Russian regulatory approval due to a strategic water license operated by the German group’s Russian subsidiary Unipro (UPRO.MM). “The company registered water supply activities at Surgutskaya GRES-2 as a natural monopoly on (its) own initiative after we announced our offer to buy Uniper shares,” Lundmark told Kommersant. Lundmark said Fortum had discussed the issue with the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia, and the regulator is considering Fortum’s application to buy the stake. Uniper’s Russian business Unipro does not plan to classify assets at its other four power stations in Russia as strategic, Interfax cited Unipro official Dmitry Ermilichev as saying on Thursday. “We have such a theoretical possibility at all five of our power plants, but we are not considering it and we are not planning such actions”. Earlier Interfax quoted Ermilichev as saying that Unipro was considering such a move. Fortum said in a separate statement it expected to close the deal by the end of the first quarter in 2020. Lundmark also said Fortum would seek to chair Uniper’s supervisory board once the deal closed. Alexander Chuvayev, head of Fortum’s Russian business, said the company hoped the Russian state would find a solution so the acquisition of Uniper could go ahead. He said while Unipro had the possibility to assign strategic status to its operations in Russia, there was no need to do so. He also said it would be possible to divest Unipro’s strategic operations to facilitate the deal. Uniper said earlier this month that Fortum had yet to address a range of questions about its intentions in the takeover talks to get management support for any deal.

234,"ANKARA   - Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said on Monday Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters had emptied a jail holding Islamic State prisoners in a part of Syria where Ankara is mounting an offensive, and that the prisoners there had been abducted. Turkey launched a cross-border operation against the YPG militia in northeastern Syria last week, after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to withdraw forces from two posts in the area in a move that drew strong international criticism. The Turkish assault has prompted alarm that it could allow Islamic State (IS) militants to escape Kurdish-run prisons in northern Syria and regroup. Ankara has dismissed those concerns. Turkey’s stated objective is to clear its southern frontier region of the YPG, which it views as a terrorist organization, and form a “safe zone” 30 km (20 miles) into Syrian territory where it wants to settle millions of Syrian refugees. Ankara also pledged to take responsibility for IS militants within the “safe zone”, but said it would not be accountable for others. Speaking to reporters in Ankara on Monday, Akar said the YPG had emptied the only Islamic State prison that Turkish forces had so far reached in the envisaged “safe zone” area, and that the inmates had already been removed. “As you know, there is a prison issue on this Daesh (Islamic State) topic. We are determined to show the utmost effort on these prisons. However, there was only one prison in our region, a Daesh prison,” Akar said. “When we went there, we saw that it had been emptied by the YPG and the Islamic State militants there had been abducted. We determined this through photographs and film, talked to our counterpart, and will continue to do so,” he added. Akar did not say how many prisoners were believed to have been taken from the jail, nor did he elaborate on who had taken the prisoners and where. There was no immediate YPG comment. Trump, providing no evidence, tweeted on Monday that Kurdish forces might be freeing IS prisoners deliberately to lure U.S. troops back into the region. Escaped fighters could be “easily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came, but they should move quickly”, Trump said. Later on Monday, Turkish media broadcast footage of what it said was the prison emptied by the YPG in central Tel Abyad, along the Turkish border. The footage showed Turkish soldiers roaming through an empty building with jail cells built inside. The fighting has raised Western concerns that the Kurds, holding large tracts of northern Syria previously controlled by Islamic State, would be unable to keep thousands of jihadists in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps. The region’s Kurdish-led administration said 785 IS-affiliated foreigners escaped a camp at Ain Issa at the weekend.

377,"WASHINGTON   - Blacklisted Chinese telecoms equipment giant Huawei is in early-stage talks with some U.S. telecoms companies about licensing its 5G network technology to them, a Huawei executive told Reuters on Friday.  Vincent Pang, senior vice president and board director at the company said some firms had expressed interest in both a long-term deal or a one-off transfer, declining to name or quantify the companies. “There are some companies talking to us, but it would take a long journey to really finalize everything,” Pang explained on a visit to Washington this week. “They have shown interest,” he added, saying conversations are only a couple of weeks old and not at a detailed level yet. The U.S. government, fearing Huawei equipment could be used to spy on customers, has led a campaign to convince allies to bar it from their 5G networks. Huawei has repeatedly denied the claim. Currently there are no U.S. 5G providers and European rivals Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and Nokia (NOKIA.HE) are generally more expensive. In May, Huawei, the world’s largest telecoms equipment provider, was placed on a U.S. blacklist over national security concerns, banning it from buying American-made parts without a special license. Washington also has brought criminal charges against the company, alleging bank fraud, violations of U.S. sanctions against Iran, and theft of trade secrets, which Huawei denies.  Rules that were due out from the Commerce Department earlier this month are expected to effectively ban the company from the U.S. telecoms supply chain. The idea of a one-off fee in exchange for access to Huawei’s 5G patents, licenses, code and know-how was first floated by CEO and founder Ren Zhengfei in interviews with the New York Times and the Economist last month. But it was not previously clear whether there was any interest from U.S. companies. In an interview with Reuters last month, a State Department official expressed skepticism of Ren’s offer. “It’s just not realistic that carriers would take on this equipment and then manage all of the software and hardware themselves,” the person said. “If there are software bugs that are built in to the initial software, there would be no way to necessarily tell that those are there and they could be activated at any point, even if the software code is turned over to the mobile operators,” the official added. For his part, Pang declined to predict whether any deal might be signed. However, he warned that the research and development investment required by continuously improving the platform after a single-transfer from Huawei would be very costly for the companies.  Huawei has spent billions to develop its 5G technology since 2009.

442,"ZURICH   - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) will start charging wealthy clients with large cash deposits in Swiss francs, the latest Swiss bank to pass on negative interest rates to customers. Individual and business customers will be charged a rate of -0.75% on cash balances above 2 million Swiss francs ($2.02 million), Switzerland’s second biggest lender said. Balances of less than 2 million francs will be unaffected.  A rate of -0.85% will be imposed on business customers with balances above 10 million francs.  The new rules take effect from Jan. 1 for individual customers and Nov. 15 for business customers. Credit Suisse’s cross-town rival UBS (UBSG.S) in July said it would charge a -0.75% rate on deposits above 2 million francs, while Postfinance charges fees to private customers with balances above 500,000 francs. Several banks in Switzerland, including private bank Julius Baer (BAER.S), and the eurozone also pass on the cost of negative official rates to corporate depositors, though most large players have refrained from doing so with individual clients.  “As other banks have been doing for some time, Credit Suisse is introducing negative interest rates for clients with very high Swiss franc cash holdings,” Credit Suisse said on Friday. “The reason for this is the persistent negative interest rate environment.” The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has charged a negative rate of -0.75% since January 2015 on deposits parked with the central bank by commercial banks overnight, one of the tools the SNB uses to deter investor appetite for the Swiss franc. Many economists expect the SNB to take the interest rate lower next year to prevent further strengthening of the safe-haven currency, which could damage Switzerland’s export-reliant economy.

550,"SEATTLE   - Boeing Co (BA.N) Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told employees he was “fully supportive” of the board’s decision to split his chairman and CEO roles, allowing him to focus on running the world’s largest planemaker, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Wednesday. A Boeing spokesman did not provide an immediate comment. Muilenburg said the “division of labor” was the latest action taken by the board and senior company leaders to “strengthen Boeing’s governance and safety management processes” as it struggles to get its fastest-selling 737 MAX jetliner back into the air following deadly crashes. “I’m accountable to you, our customers, the flying public and all of our stakeholders for delivering on this - and each of us carries our share of the responsibility,” Muilenburg said in the memo sent after the board’s decision was announced on Friday. Boeing said the board had stripped Muilenburg of his chairmanship title, in an unexpected strategy shift after months of pressure capped by a global aviation task force report that criticized development of the 737 MAX.  Lead Director David Calhoun, a senior managing director at Blackstone Group, will take over as non-executive chairman, Boeing said. It added that the board had “full confidence” in Muilenburg, who will retain the CEO and president titles and remain on the board. “I’m fully supportive of this division of labor and look forward to continuing my close partnership with Dave,” Muilenburg told employees in the memo. The decision came some six months after Muilenburg survived a shareholder motion to split his chairman and CEO roles, part of the intense pressure he has faced during the worst crisis of his four years at the helm. Muilenburg is set to testify before a U.S. House panel later this month and lawmakers have raised questions about Boeing’s actions prior to the 737 MAX certification.  Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Transportation Department Inspector General and several blue-ribbon panels are also investigating the plane’s approval.

607,"  - MGM Resorts International (MGM.N) said on Tuesday it would sell its Bellagio and Circus Circus resorts in Las Vegas in separate deals valued at about $5 billion, as the U.S. casino operator seeks to monetize its real estate assets and bolster its balance sheet. Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust will acquire the Bellagio for $4.25 billion through a 95-5 joint venture with MGM and will lease it back to a unit of the casino company for an initial annual rent of $245 million.  MGM said it would sell Circus Circus Las Vegas to an affiliate of Treasure Island owner Phil Ruffin for $825 million. The divestment come nine months after MGM, which had a long-term debt of $15 billion as of December 2018, formed a committee to evaluate its real estate portfolio amid its move to an asset-light model. MGM Chief Executive Officer Jim Murren said the company would use the proceeds from both the deals to “build a fortress balance sheet” and return capital to shareholders. Both deals are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019. MGM’s other assets include MGM Grand and MGM pringfield and it also holds stakes in CityCenter and MGM Growth Properties LLC. In January, MGM announced plans to cut costs and boost growth, proposing to increase annualized adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by $300 million by the end of 2021.

648,"VIENNA   - Plane parts maker FACC’s (FACC.VI) operating profit fell 6% in the second quarter as it produced fewer components for the Airbus (AIR.PA) A380 and Boeing (BA.N) 737NG jets being phased out and start-up costs for new cabin interiors bit.   Chinese-owned FACC makes components for wings, tail assemblies and fuselages as well as engines and cabin interiors for all major planemakers.  So far 2019 has been a slow year for the commercial aerospace industry, beset by negative headlines on safety following two deadly plane crashes and the U.S.-China trade war.  FACC said in its half annual report on Tuesday that while production rates of all major aircraft types had stabilized at a high level, no significant increases were expected for 2020. “We expect sustained growth in the aviation industry in the long run, but are currently observing a slight flattening of the growth curve,” Chief Executive Robert Machtlinger said. “This trend is reflected in our sales development, which shows a smaller increase than planned.” However, operational measures to reduce costs were progressing and would lead to stable profitability from the second half of 2020, he said.   Its shares fell 2.6% in early trading. Owned by China’s Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC) (000768.SZ), the group reported earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 8.6 million euros ($9.5 million) on largely flat revenue of 179.7 million in the three months through end-August. New orders surpassed $800 million. Around half of FACC’s revenue comes from Airbus (AIR.PA), which reported a 13.5% rise in nine-month deliveries, well ahead of U.S. rival Boeing, whose deliveries nearly halved due to the  grounding of the B737 MAX. FACC does not supply the new aircraft, which has been grounded following two deadly crashes.  A decision by the World Trade Organization, which formally authorized the United States on Monday to impose tariffs on Airbus aircraft, does not cover aircraft components “and thus products of the FACC Group are not affected,” the company said.  FACC also produces components for Chinese planemaker COMAC, which Machtlinger expects to become a fierce rival to Airbus and Boeing within 10 years. Revenues for COMAC’s ARJ 21 regional jet and the narrow-body C919 increased in the first half and have become a major revenue driver at the cabin interior unit, FACC said.  FACC expects sales of around 600 million euros and an EBIT margin of close to 6% for its shortened March-December 2019  financial year. From 2020, the group will report per calendar year.

750,"  - Boeing Co’s (BA.N) board has stripped chief executive Dennis Muilenburg of his chairmanship title, in an unexpected strategy shift announced by the U.S. planemaker on Friday only hours after a global aviation panel criticized development of the troubled 737 MAX. Separating the roles, which will enable Muilenburg to have “maximum focus” on steering daily operations, was the latest step the board has taken in recent weeks to improve executive oversight of its engineering ranks and industrial operations.  Lead Director David Calhoun, a senior managing director at Blackstone Group, will takeover as non-executive chairman, Boeing said in its announcement, which came late on Friday afternoon without warning. It added that the board had “full confidence” in Muilenburg, who will retain the top job and remain on the board. The decision came as Boeing struggles to get its best-selling 737 MAX back into service following a worldwide safety ban in March triggered by two crashes that killed a total of 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia. It also comes some six months after Muilenburg survived a shareholder motion to split his chairman and CEO roles, part of the intense pressure he has faced during the worst crisis of his four years at the helm of the world’s largest planemaker. “This decision is the latest of several actions by the board of directors and Boeing senior leadership to strengthen the company’s governance and safety management processes,” the company said.  Earlier on Friday, an international aviation panel criticized U.S. regulators and Boeing over the certification of the plane. An internal review in August revealed that the company was working to reorganize its engineering reporting lines company-wide and ensure higher ranking officials, including its CEO, get faster feedback about potential safety concerns from lower levels of the company. As part of the move, Muilenburg received granular weekly reports of potential safety issues discussed at meetings of rank-and-file engineers.  It also plans to name a new director with deep safety experience and expertise to serve on the board and its newly created Aerospace Safety Committee in the near term, Boeing said. Muilenburg is set to testify before a U.S. House panel on Oct. 30 and lawmakers have raised questions about Boeing’s actions prior to the 737 MAX certification. Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Transportation Department Inspector General and several blue-ribbon panels are investigating the plane’s approval.     The company is also facing more than 100 lawsuits over the crashes alleging design flaws allowed erroneous sensor data to set off an automated anti-stall system and overwhelm pilots. Earlier this week, Reuters reported that a key certification test flight would likely not take place until at least Nov. 1, a move that will push its approval to resume flights until at least December. On Friday, United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL.O) became the latest U.S. airline to say it would not resume 737 MAX flights until January. Shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services Inc and Glass Lewis had urged Boeing to split the role of chairman and CEO in April, saying shareholders would benefit from a robust form of independent oversight.  Muilenburg is set to testify before a U.S. House panel on Oct. 30. Lawmakers have raised questions about Boeing’s actions prior to the 737 MAX certification.

823,"WASHINGTON   - Walmart Inc (WMT.N) said on Thursday its chief executive for U.S. operations, Greg Foran, will leave the company early next year and be replaced by the head of its Sam’s Club warehouse chain unit, John Furner.  Foran’s departure is likely to be considered a blow for Walmart given the New Zealand native is credited with turning around Walmart’s U.S. business by focusing on improving existing stores. Walmart reported 20 quarters of comparable sales growth under his leadership. Foran, who has held the job since 2014, will stay with Walmart until Jan. 31 and then take on the role of chief executive at Air New Zealand Ltd (AIR.NZ), an appointment that was also announced separately by the airline. Walmart Inc Chief Executive Doug McMillon said Foran’s ability to innovate, including using new technology, “has helped position us for the future.” However, some investors were skeptical of the change in leadership. “While we’ve been highly impressed with Mr. Furner’s work at Sam’s Club... he does admittedly have big shoes to fill,” said a note from Jefferies Group LLC (JEF.N). “We can’t help but expect the market to react negatively to today’s news.” Furner has run the $57.8 billion Sam’s Club business since 2017. Over that time, he has improved the unit’s performance with higher comparable sales by pushing the retailer to innovate, shutting stores, and repurposing stores as distribution hubs. Walmart in August raised its forecasts for U.S. comparable sales for the full year. Its shares have risen 28% so far this year.

The cost of chartering a supertanker to send crude oil from one country to another is rising sharply. A South Korean importer paid more than $12 million in shipping costs for one crude shipment from the U.S. Gulf Coast. This was followed by Friday’s tentative charter of another crude vessel by Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) for $13.25 million to ship in November.   The United States in late September imposed sanctions on two units of China’s COSCO (600026.SS) for their alleged involvement in bringing crude oil from Iran. U.S. Gulf Coast exporters, in turn, have held back from chartering COSCO-linked vessels. COSCO operates more than 50 supertankers, the largest vessels for carrying crude oil or fuel products.  About one-third of those tankers have shut off their ship-tracking transponders since the U.S. sanctions, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Last week, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) banned the use of vessels linked to oil flows from Venezuela in the last year, affecting some 250 ships. Exxon is the largest U.S. oil company and a major shipper, and its move caused rates to rise further, market sources have said.  The move comes several months after the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela in an attempt to cut off the nation’s oil revenue in a bid to oust President Nicolas Maduro, who is accused of human rights violations and rigging the 2018 presidential election. Maduro calls opposition leader Juan Guaido a U.S. puppet. In addition, Unipec, the shipping arm of China’s Sinopec, has also said it will not use vessels that have been linked to flows out of Venezuela for the same time period. DO THE ATTACKS ON SAUDI ARAMCO’S FACILITIES HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS?  A small amount. After those attacks last month, shippers worldwide scrambled to secure cargoes for big buyers in Asia, and many of them turned to the United States. That boosted rates, though the current surge is tied more to sanctions on COSCO and Exxon’s moves. New maritime rules capping the amount of sulfur used in fuels for shipping have added to rising rates, because they raise the cost for shipowners who had in the past relied on “bunker fuel” - and as of Jan. 1 will have to switch to cleaner-burning marine fuel or diesel fuel.

839,"NEW YORK   - Oil prices rose on Thursday, buoyed by comments by the head of OPEC that the organization could take action to balance oil markets and will decide in December on supply for next year.  Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo did not specify whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would extend a pact to rein in production to stabilize prices, but the comments appeared to inspire hope in the market. “Barkindo was sending a signal that OPEC was serious about supporting prices,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group. “Between this and a possible China trade deal, the momentum has shifted.”  Global benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up 78 cents or 1.3% at $59.10 a barrel. In post-settlement trade, Brent extended gains to rise $1 on the day to $59.32 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures CLc1 were up 96 cents, or 1.8%, at $53.55 a barrel.   A December meeting between OPEC plus allies including Russia would take “decisions that will set us on the path of heightened and sustained stability for 2020,” Barkindo said. “Barkindo’s comment reminds markets that if oil prices do not fall off a cliff over demand concerns, we could ... see OPEC+ extend their production cuts throughout the majority of 2020,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.  Separately, Saudi Arabia told OPEC its monthly oil output fell by 660,000 bpd in September after major attacks on its energy facilities, while OPEC lowered its 2020 forecast for non-OPEC supply growth. Additionally, Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to discuss stabilizing world oil prices when he visits Saudi Arabia on Monday for talks with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Kremlin said. While signals from OPEC suggested a tighter oil market outlook, price gains were curbed by a report of rising stockpiles in the United States, the world’s biggest oil producer. U.S. crude stocks rose by 2.9 million barrels in the week to Oct. 4, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday, more than double analyst expectations. Additionally, OPEC member Nigeria secured a higher production target and a force majeure over exports from the Bonny Light stream was lifted. Venezuela will boost its exports despite U.S. economic sanctions that have curtailed shipments as Indian refiner Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) plans to start loading Venezuelan crude after a four-month pause. Uncertainty over U.S.-China trade talks resuming on Thursday had previously weighed on the market. Still, there has not been a sustained rally or fall in prices in recent months, though both oil benchmarks are down more than 20% from April peaks. “The oil market is neither bullish nor bearish. It is not trending. It has no reason or excuse to trend,” said Tamas Varga of oil brokerage PVM. “It would be stretching it to say that the market is paralyzed, but it is in a stalemate. No one is willing to commit to either direction.” ",Oil prices rise as OPEC pledges decision on supply,"October 10, 2019 /  1:43 AM ",new york oil prices rose on thursday buoyed by comments by the head of opec that the organization could take action to balance oil markets and will decide in december on supply for next year secretary general mohammad barkindo did not specify whether the organization of the petroleum exporting countries would extend a pact to rein in production to stabilize prices but the comments appeared to inspire hope in the market barkindo was sending a signal that opec was serious about supporting prices said phil flynn an analyst at price futures group between this and a possible china trade deal the momentum has shifted global benchmark brent crude futures lcoc settled up  cents or   at   a barrel in post settlement trade brent extended gains to rise  on the day to   a barrel u s west texas intermediate wti futures clc were up  cents or   at   a barrel a december meeting between opec plus allies including russia would take decisions that will set us on the path of heightened and sustained stability for  barkindo said barkindo s comment reminds markets that if oil prices do not fall off a cliff over demand concerns we could see opec extend their production cuts throughout the majority of  said edward moya senior market analyst at oanda in new york separately saudi arabia told opec its monthly oil output fell by   bpd in september after major attacks on its energy facilities while opec lowered its  forecast for non opec supply growth additionally russian president vladimir putin plans to discuss stabilizing world oil prices when he visits saudi arabia on monday for talks with saudi king salman and crown prince mohammed bin salman the kremlin said while signals from opec suggested a tighter oil market outlook price gains were curbed by a report of rising stockpiles in the united states the world s biggest oil producer u s crude stocks rose by   million barrels in the week to oct  the energy information administration eia said on wednesday more than double analyst expectations additionally opec member nigeria secured a higher production target and a force majeure over exports from the bonny light stream was lifted venezuela will boost its exports despite u s economic sanctions that have curtailed shipments as indian refiner reliance industries reli ns plans to start loading venezuelan crude after a four month pause uncertainty over u s china trade talks resuming on thursday had previously weighed on the market still there has not been a sustained rally or fall in prices in recent months though both oil benchmarks are down more than  from april peaks the oil market is neither bullish nor bearish it is not trending it has no reason or excuse to trend said tamas varga of oil brokerage pvm it would be stretching it to say that the market is paralyzed but it is in a stalemate no one is willing to commit to either direction ,Brexit,0.21578601002693176
862,"PARIS   - A strong sales update from LVMH (LVMH.PA) boosted stocks across the luxury goods sector on Thursday, as months of unrest in Hong Kong proved less of a drag on the Louis Vuitton owner in the third quarter than expected.  Luxury labels rely on Hong Kong as a magnet for travelers and shoppers across Asia, and several months of pro-democracy protests have forced some retailers to close their doors temporarily.  In the first real glimpse of the impact across the sector, LVMH said revenues were down roughly 25% in the July to September period in Hong Kong. Analysts had projected industry sales there could potentially have halved.  But the French conglomerate, which owns labels from Christian Dior to Hublot watches and Krug champagne, also cautioned that the demonstrations would impact margins in what is usually a highly profitable market.  And the group said the fallout was not yet over, as store closures had stretched into October.  “We will try to react to the situation by lowering our cost base. And chiefly the rental costs, which are amongst the highest in the world,” LVMH Financial Chief Jean-Jacques Guiony told a conference call on Thursday, adding that discussions were underway with landlords.  Helped by a booming fashion and handbag division - home to Vuitton and Dior - LVMH shrugged off much of the hit from Hong Kong, with a strong performance in the rest of Asia, Europe and the United States, and third-quarter sales beat forecasts.         Some countries performed particularly well, such as Japan, while business in France also improved, although Guiony said it was hard to conclude that it was necessarily due to spending shifting away from Hong Kong to those sectors.  Japan increased its sales tax from 8% to 10% on Oct. 1, for instance, which helped spur purchases ahead of the deadline. LVMH shares were up 4.8% by 1449 GMT, while the stock prices of rivals from Gucci owner Kering (PRTP.PA) and Birkin-handbag maker Hermes (HRMS.PA) to Germany’s Hugo Boss (BOSSn.DE) and Britain’s Burberry (BRBY.L) also rallied. Cartier and IWC parent Richemont (CFR.S) as well as Omega maker Swatch Group (UHR.S) - among the most exposed groups to Hong Kong, a major center for watch exports - profited from the stock market bounce. Sales growth in LVMH’s watch division slowed less sharply than expected.      Some analysts have warned that LVMH may be an outlier in the industry, however.  It is riding high on massive investments in marketing and hot new designers for its top brands, and has benefited more than most from thriving demand for luxury wares from Chinese shoppers in recent years.  Gucci, Hermes and Italy’s Moncler (MONC.MI) are also among the stronger performers, but some peers are struggling to attract younger customers or crack markets such as mainland China, and the divide in the sector is growing.  “We think it is more than likely that LVMH materially outperformed its direct peers,” analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note.  Luxury firms also benefited from a stock market relief rally  after leather handbags and spirits such as cognac - LVMH produces Hennessy - were left off a list of new U.S. tariffs. But some have pointed to a tougher economic backdrop in the United States in recent quarters, one of several headwinds with which the industry is grappling.  Guiony said that a sharp slowdown in make-up sales, particularly in the United States, had extended into the third quarter - a potential setback for big cosmetics players like L’Oreal OREp.PA or Estee Lauder (EL.N).

891,"SHANGHAI/HONG KONG   - State-owned financial conglomerate China Everbright Group aims to restructure its sprawling business and pursue a billion dollar IPO next year in Hong Kong, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday. While the offering size has yet to be finalised, the initial public offering (IPO) will likely be at least in the billion-dollar bracket, two of the people said. The third person estimated that Everbright, backed by sovereign wealth fund subsidiary Central Huijin Investment Ltd and China’s Ministry of Finance, could raise up to $3 billion. The Fortune 500 company has recently hired U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Chinese peers China International Capital Corp Ltd (CICC) (3908.HK) and CITIC Securities Co Ltd (600030.SS) as restructuring advisers, the people said. The advisers will help the group - with businesses as varied as banking, insurance, aircraft leasing and environmental protection services - to finalize details, such as what assets will be listed and under which entity, two of the people said. Everbright Group, JPMorgan, CICC and CITIC Securities did not respond to requests for comment. The three people declined to be identified as the information was not public. Beijing-based Everbright has been exploring IPO plans since the first half of the year and has been asking another state-owned conglomerate, CITIC Group Corp, for guidance and advice, said one of the people. The group decided to list in Hong Kong rather than Shanghai partially because the process is shorter and there are fewer uncertainties, the person said. Like many heads at Chinese state-owned enterprises, Everbright Chairman Li Xiaopeng who joined the group in December 2017 from another state-backed conglomerate, China Merchants Group Ltd, is a senior Communist Party official.  One of the people said a successful IPO would likely help Li, 60, climb further up the ranks of the Party. Everbright’s IPO pursuit in Hong Kong comes as Asia’s top financial hub looks to be back in business with companies forging ahead with listing plans after a freeze during months of frequently violent anti-government protests. Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd (1876.HK) last month raised about $5 billion in Hong Kong, in this year’s second-largest IPO worldwide. On Thursday, Chinese sportswear manufacturer Topsports International Holdings Ltd (6110.HK) debuted on the Hong Kong stock exchange after raising $1.01 billion. Everbright, one of mainland China’s oldest and biggest financial conglomerates, was founded in Hong Kong in 1983, early in China’s economic reform era. The group now has registered capital of 60 billion yuan ($8.41 billion) and about 11 stock market-listed entities including China Everbright Bank Co Ltd (601818.SS), Everbright Securities Co Ltd (601788.SS) and asset manager China Everbright Ltd (0165.HK).

921,"NEW YORK   - Support for U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren rose more than that of any other Democratic presidential hopeful over the past month, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, solidifying her status as a top contender behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. The Sept. 9-10 poll found that 11% of Democrats and independents said they would vote for Warren in their state’s nominating contests, up 3 percentage points from a similar poll that ran Aug. 1 to 5.  Twenty-two percent said they backed Biden, the former vice president who has been the Democratic front-runner since he entered the race this year, and 16% said they would vote for Sanders, a U.S. senator. Biden’s support was unchanged from the previous Reuters/Ipsos poll, while Sanders dropped 2 percentage points. Biden, Sanders and Harris will square off with seven other Democratic candidates on Thursday at a nationally televised debate in Houston. The Democratic contenders are vying for the right to take on Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election. Warren, a champion of consumer financial protections, has pushed for big, “structural” changes to an economy that “does great for those with money and isn’t doing great for everyone else.” She wants to raise taxes on the wealthy and use the money to help pay for a number of progressive priorities including universal childcare, student debt relief and Medicare for All, which would provide federal health insurance coverage for all Americans based on the existing government-run Medicare program for Americans 65 and older.   Unlike most of the other candidates, Warren’s popularity among Democrats and independents has steadily increased this year. Others, like U.S. Senator Kamala Harris, have declined in popularity over the summer. The September poll found that Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, were each supported by 4% of Democrats and independents. Buttigieg’s support was unchanged from the August poll, while Harris dipped 2 points. New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang and U.S. Senator Cory Booker were each backed by 3%.  None of the other candidates received more than 2% in the poll. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, across the United States. It gathered responses from 687 adults, including 511 Democrats and 104 independents. It had a credibility interval, a measure of the poll’s precision, of 4 percentage points.

925,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. job openings fell to a 1-1/2-year low in August and hiring declined, suggesting employment growth was slowing largely because of ebbing demand for labor as the economy loses momentum. Despite the third straight monthly drop in vacancies reported by the Labor Department on Wednesday, job openings are  still plenty enough to ease financial market fears of a looming recession. Job openings are being closely watched for signs of whether an erosion in business confidence, which has weighed on capital investment, is spilling over to hiring. A 15-month trade war between the United States and China has hurt business confidence, leading to a retrenchment in business spending and a downturn in manufacturing. The trade war has stoked financial market fears of a recession. “The labor market is slipping a little, but it’s not flashing any recession signals yet,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “You can’t have a recession with 7 million help wanted signs posted up in factory and store windows around the country.” Job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped by 123,000 to a seasonally adjusted 7.05 million in August, the lowest level since March 2018, the government said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. Job openings have been trending lower this year since scaling an all-time high of 7.63 million in late 2018. The job openings rate fell to 4.4% in August from 4.5% in July. While the Federal Reserve continues to view the labor market as strong, minutes of the U.S. central bank’s Sept. 17-18 policy meeting showed some officials believed “it would be important to be vigilant in monitoring incoming data for any sign of softening in labor market conditions.” This was in response to a recent estimate from the Labor Department that the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade.  That suggested job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000.  U.S. stocks were trading higher as a report that China was open to a partial trade deal soothed investor nerves ahead of high-level talks on Thursday. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury prices fell. The reduction in vacancies in August was led by manufacturing, with job openings in the nondurable goods industries falling by 49,000. Manufacturing, which the Trump administration has sought to boost with import tariffs, has ironically borne the brunt of the trade war.  The White House says the duties are necessary to protect manufacturing from what it says is unfair foreign competition. There were 47,000 fewer job openings in the information sector in August. Economists said the JOLTS data would be closely monitored for clues as to when the longest economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year, might end. Graphic: U.S. wholesale inventories - here Graphic: JOLTS: Job openings, hires and quits - here “Although we only have data for the two prior recessions, on both occasions there was a decline in the job openings rate before the onset of recession,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.  “The job openings data bear close watching in the coming months to see if the softening in corporate demand for capex (capital expenditures) is beginning to spill over in the demand for labor.”  Hiring declined by 199,000 jobs to 5.8 million in August, led by decreases in the private sector, which fell by 219,000. Federal government hiring increased by 35,000, likely reflecting recruitment for the 2020 Census. The hiring rate slipped to 3.8% from 3.9% in July. The decrease in hiring fits in with a declining trend in job growth. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 136,000 jobs in September, down from 168,000 in August, the government reported last Friday. The three-month average gain in private employment fell to 119,000, the smallest since July 2012, from 135,000 in August.  Job gains remain above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate fell to near a 50-year low of 3.5% in September from 3.7% in August. There were 1.17 unfilled jobs for every unemployed person in August. With the labor market slowing, the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs dropped. The quits rate fell to 2.3% from 2.4% in July. The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. Layoffs were little changed in August, with the rate holding at 1.2%.  Slowing economic growth was underscored by a separate report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing wholesale inventories rose by a revised 0.2% in August. Stocks at wholesalers were previously estimated to have advanced 0.4%. August’s gain matched July’s increase, suggesting inventory investment could remain a drag on economic growth in the third quarter. The pace of inventory accumulation has been slowing after stocks increased strongly from the third quarter of 2018 through the first quarter of this year.  The inventory overhang has led businesses to place fewer orders at factories, contributing to the manufacturing slump. “The current inventory glut spells problems for U.S. production and output growth over the next few quarters,” said Maria Cosma, an economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. “As long as the inventory-to-sales ratio remains elevated, producers do not have the go-ahead to ramp up production.”  A slower pace of inventory accumulation in the second quarter contributed to holding back economic growth to a 2.0% annualized rate during the period. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter. Growth estimates for the third quarter range from as low as a 1.5% annualized rate to as high as a 2.0% pace.

934,"  - Republican Dan Bishop won a special U.S. congressional election in North Carolina on Tuesday, turning back a vigorous Democratic challenge to save a longtime stronghold for President Donald Trump’s party. With 99% of precincts reporting, Bishop, a 55-year-old state senator for whom Trump campaigned, led Democrat Dan McCready, a 36-year-old veteran of the Marines, 50.81% to 48.59%, the state board of elections said. North Carolina’s 9th congressional district, a suburban-rural area in the southeastern part of the state, has been represented by Republicans in Congress since the 1960s and voted for Trump by about 12 percentage points in 2016.  But Democrats thought they had a chance to flip it and build on the majority they won in the House of Representatives last year. McCready lost by a slim margin in 2018 before state officials ruled the election was tainted by an absentee-ballot fraud scheme that benefited his Republican opponent, Mark Harris, and ordered a new vote. Harris did not run again. Both parties poured millions of dollars into the election do-over, with the final contest of the 2018 congressional midterms being watched for signs of their prospects in 2020. Trump, who flew to the district on Monday night to rally the Republican base for Bishop, moved immediately to take credit. “Dan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. He then asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race,” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The Trump campaign national press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said Trump’s endorsement “has the power to change the trajectory of political races ... Dan Bishop won this evening & Trump’s endorsement carried him to victory!” On Monday, McEnany said the Trump campaign did not believe the results of the special election would be predictive for 2020. Republicans also won a special election in another district in North Carolina where they had been expected to do so. Republican Greg Murphy defeated Democrat Allen Thomas for a seat left vacant by longtime Republican Representative Walter Jones’ death in February by 61.74% to 37.47%, according to the state board of election results.  Bishop thanked Trump and vowed to support the president’s agenda in Washington. He said his victory should send a message nationwide that voters were rejecting the “radical, liberal policies being pushed by today’s Democratic Party.” “Tonight was the first step toward taking back the House of Representatives in 2020 to keep this country on a path of prosperity and strength,” the Republican told a cheering crowd. Republicans hope the victory will help the party launch a comeback effort to wrest the House away from Democrats after losing 40 seats and overall control in House elections last November.  A wave of recent Republican retirements from the House has fueled speculation that Republicans fear they will not win the 19 seats they need to regain the majority in that chamber next year.  Democrats had been hoping to show that 2018 was not their high-water mark and looked to further weaken support for Trump and his Republicans in suburban areas. Political analysts noted McCready did improve his standing over the previous election in the suburbs of Charlotte. But a poor showing with rural Trump-supporting Democrats cost the party a pickup, analyst David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report said on Twitter. The chairwoman of the Democratic congressional campaign arm, Representative Cheri Bustos, said Democrats had fallen “an inch” short but that Republicans had required millions in spending and a Trump rally just to “scrape by.”   “Tonight’s razor-thin result in this ruby-red district solidifies the fact that Democrats are pushing further into Republican strongholds and are in a commanding position to protect and expand our House Majority in 2020,” she said. Bishop campaigned on taxes, the economy and immigration. He echoed Trump’s political themes, asserting that McCready “admires socialism” and linking him to the “Squad,” a group of progressive Democrats in the House who Trump has repeatedly attacked. McCready, a small businessman, sought to steer the campaign discussion away from Trump and onto issues such as healthcare, education and teacher pay. He labeled Bishop, who sponsored a 2016 measure in the state legislature restricting public restroom access for transgender people, as a “career politician.” “We may not have won this campaign, but that does not mean that we were wrong,” McCready said in his concession speech Tuesday night. “And as long as there are people who thrive off our division, there is still work to be done.” ",Trump-backed Republican wins North Carolina special congressional election,"September 10, 2019 /  10:13 AM ", republican dan bishop won a special u s congressional election in north carolina on tuesday turning back a vigorous democratic challenge to save a longtime stronghold for president donald trump s party with  of precincts reporting bishop a  year old state senator for whom trump campaigned led democrat dan mccready a  year old veteran of the marines   to   the state board of elections said north carolina s th congressional district a suburban rural area in the southeastern part of the state has been represented by republicans in congress since the s and voted for trump by about  percentage points in  but democrats thought they had a chance to flip it and build on the majority they won in the house of representatives last year mccready lost by a slim margin in  before state officials ruled the election was tainted by an absentee ballot fraud scheme that benefited his republican opponent mark harris and ordered a new vote harris did not run again both parties poured millions of dollars into the election do over with the final contest of the  congressional midterms being watched for signs of their prospects in  trump who flew to the district on monday night to rally the republican base for bishop moved immediately to take credit dan bishop was down  points  weeks ago he then asked me for help we changed his strategy together and he ran a great race trump wrote on twitter the trump campaign national press secretary kayleigh mcenany said trump s endorsement has the power to change the trajectory of political races dan bishop won this evening trump s endorsement carried him to victory on monday mcenany said the trump campaign did not believe the results of the special election would be predictive for  republicans also won a special election in another district in north carolina where they had been expected to do so republican greg murphy defeated democrat allen thomas for a seat left vacant by longtime republican representative walter jones death in february by   to   according to the state board of election results bishop thanked trump and vowed to support the president s agenda in washington he said his victory should send a message nationwide that voters were rejecting the radical liberal policies being pushed by today s democratic party tonight was the first step toward taking back the house of representatives in  to keep this country on a path of prosperity and strength the republican told a cheering crowd republicans hope the victory will help the party launch a comeback effort to wrest the house away from democrats after losing  seats and overall control in house elections last november a wave of recent republican retirements from the house has fueled speculation that republicans fear they will not win the  seats they need to regain the majority in that chamber next year democrats had been hoping to show that  was not their high water mark and looked to further weaken support for trump and his republicans in suburban areas political analysts noted mccready did improve his standing over the previous election in the suburbs of charlotte but a poor showing with rural trump supporting democrats cost the party a pickup analyst david wasserman of the cook political report said on twitter the chairwoman of the democratic congressional campaign arm representative cheri bustos said democrats had fallen an inch short but that republicans had required millions in spending and a trump rally just to scrape by tonight s razor thin result in this ruby red district solidifies the fact that democrats are pushing further into republican strongholds and are in a commanding position to protect and expand our house majority in  she said bishop campaigned on taxes the economy and immigration he echoed trump s political themes asserting that mccready admires socialism and linking him to the squad a group of progressive democrats in the house who trump has repeatedly attacked mccready a small businessman sought to steer the campaign discussion away from trump and onto issues such as healthcare education and teacher pay he labeled bishop who sponsored a  measure in the state legislature restricting public restroom access for transgender people as a career politician we may not have won this campaign but that does not mean that we were wrong mccready said in his concession speech tuesday night and as long as there are people who thrive off our division there is still work to be done ,Brexit,0.2666952610015869
954,"WASHINGTON/SHANGHAI   - The U.S. government widened its trade blacklist to include some of China’s top artificial intelligence startups, punishing Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities and ratcheting up tensions ahead of high-level trade talks in Washington this week. The decision, which drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing, targets 20 Chinese public security bureaus and eight companies including video surveillance firm Hikvision, as well as leaders in facial recognition technology SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology Ltd.      The action bars the firms from buying components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval - a potentially crippling move for some of them. It follows the same blueprint used by Washington in its attempt to limit the influence of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for what it says are national security reasons. U.S. officials said the action was not tied to this week’s resumption of trade talks with China, but it signals no let-up in U.S. President Donald Trump’s hard-line stance as the world’s two biggest economies seek to end their 15-month trade war.  The Commerce Department said in a filing the “entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.” “The U.S. Government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China,” said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. China said the United States should stop interfering in its affairs. It will continue to take firm and resolute measures to protect its sovereign security, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular media briefing without elaborating.   Hikvision, with a market value of about $42 billion, calls itself the world’s largest maker of video surveillance gear.  SenseTime, which says it is valued at more than $7.5 billion, is one of the world’s most valuable AI unicorns while Megvii, backed by e-commerce giant Alibaba, is valued at around $4 billion and is preparing an IPO to raise at least $500 million in Hong Kong. The other companies on the list are speech recognition firm iFlytek Co, surveillance equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua Technology, data recovery firm Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co, facial recognition firm Yitu Technology and Yixin Science and Technology Co. A U.S. Hikvision spokesman said the company “strongly opposes” the decision and noted that in January it retained a human rights expert and former U.S. ambassador to advise the company on human rights compliance. “Punishing Hikvision, despite these engagements, will deter global companies from communicating with the U.S. government, hurt Hikvision’s U.S. businesses partners and negatively impact the U.S. economy,” the company added. Hikvision also said that it was assessing the potential impact of the blacklisting and was working on contingency plans.  John Honovich, founder of surveillance video research company IPVM, said Hikvision and Dahua both use Intel Corp, Nvidia Corp, Ambarella Inc, Western Digital and Seagate Technology as suppliers and that the impact on the Chinese companies would be “devastating”. The blacklisting of Huawei has hurt many of its U.S. suppliers that depended on the world’s largest telecommunications company for revenue and made it difficult for Huawei to sell new products. Reuters reported in August Hikvision receives nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) in revenue from overseas. SenseTime said in a statement it was deeply disappointed by the U.S. move, that it abides by all relevant laws of the jurisdictions in which its operates and that it has been actively developing an AI code of ethics to ensure its technologies are used responsibly.  Megvii said it strongly objected to being placed on the blacklist and that it required its clients not to weaponize its technology or use it for illegal purposes. IFlytek said its placement on the blacklist would not affect its daily operations, while Xiamen Meiya said its overseas revenue was less than 1% of total revenue and that most of its suppliers were domestic companies. Dahua said on a conference call it was confident it could easily replace some components and would also seek other solutions to keep servicing clients.  IFlytek fell 2.7% and Xiamen Meiya lost 1.8% on Tuesday as investors factored in their limited exposure to overseas markets and the potential for the U.S. action to speed up restructuring, analysts said. “China’s stock market has become increasingly immune to bad news from the trade war. No more panic selling,” said Stephen Huang, vice president of Shanghai See Truth Investment Management. Hikvision and Dahua were suspended from trade at the companies’ behest. U.S. supplier Ambarella fell 12% in after-hours trading on Monday. In August, the Trump administration also released an interim rule banning federal purchases of telecommunications equipment from five Chinese companies, including Huawei and Hikvision. Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services and has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government’s restrictions.

Turnberry, one of the most famed courses in Scotland, considered the home of golf, posted a 10.8 million pound ($13.24 million) loss in 2018, according to accounts for Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd which owns the resort. That compared to a loss of 3.4 million pounds in 2017. The drop was largely the result of foreign exchange losses. Revenue at Turnberry increased to 18.5 million pounds from 15.3 million. “Trump Turnberry achieved tremendous success in 2018 as the property recorded its highest annual revenue (turnover) in the resort’s storied 113-year history,” the accounts, signed by Trump’s son Eric, said.

1046,"  - General Electric Co said on Monday it would freeze pensions for about 20,000 salaried U.S. employees and take other related moves to help the ailing conglomerate cut debt and reduce its retirement fund deficit by up to $8 billion. Analysts said the move would largely offset the rise in GE’s pension obligations due to lower interest rates and was in line with other steps Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp has taken over the past year to raise cash and pare down $105.8 billion in debt.  Culp has slashed GE’s quarterly dividend to a penny and has sold - or announced plans to sell - non-core businesses, slimming the once-sprawling company to focus just on power plants, jet engines and windmills, plus related equipment and services. GE’s pension plans are among its biggest liabilities and were underfunded by about $27 billion at the end of 2018. U.S. employees facing the pension freeze will be moved to a defined-contribution retirement plan, such as a 401(k) plan, in 2021. The company has struggled to boost profits amid a slump in demand for its gas-fired turbines for power generation. It also faces potential costs of more than $1 billion in its jet engine unit from the grounding of Boeing Co’s 737 MAX airliner.  GE also is likely to set aside about $11 billion to cover liabilities for its long-term care insurance business. By freezing the U.S. pensions, pre-paying about $4.5 billion in contributions due in 2021 and 2022 and offering lump sums to about 100,000 retirees, GE said it expects to cut pension underfunding by $5 billion to $8 billion. William Blair & Co. analyst Nicholas Heymann said there was no immediate net reduction in GE’s pension liabilities given the 90 basis-point decline in long-term interest rates since the end of last year, which has caused its pension liabilities to creep up to about $34 billion from $27 billion toward the end of 2018.  “The impact is being offset now, rather being reduced. So it is possible that investors are not cheering,” Heymann told Reuters. He added, though, that Culp “is setting up (GE for) much better performance next year.”  GE’s shares were down 0.2% at $8.55 in afternoon trading, after rising 2.6% to $8.79 in premarket trading.      The pension freeze takes effect Jan. 1, 2021. The moves also are expected to help lower GE’s net debt by $4 billion to $6 billion, the Boston-based company said, adding that there would be no change for retirees already collecting pension benefits.  GE’s industrial net debt stood at $54.4 billion as of June 30. “Returning GE to a position of strength has required us to make several difficult decisions, and today’s decision to freeze the pension is no exception,” GE Chief Human Resources Officer Kevin Cox said in a press release. GE’s pension plan has been closed to new entrants since 2012. The company had about 283,000 employees at the end of 2018, about 97,000 of them in the United States. GE expects to record a non-cash pension settlement charge in the fourth quarter, but did not specify the amount. The company also said it would pre-fund about $4 billion to $5 billion of its requirements for 2021 and 2022 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by using a portion of the $38 billion in cash it is collecting from the sale of various businesses. GE said it was on track to hit its target of less than 2.5 times net-debt-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, by the end of 2020.

1098,"WASHINGTON,   - The U.S. unemployment rate dropped to near a 50-year low of 3.5% in September, with job growth increasing moderately, suggesting the slowing economy could avoid a recession for now despite trade tensions that are hammering manufacturing. The Labor Department’s closely watched monthly employment report on Friday, however, contained reminders that the risks to the longest economic expansion on record remained tilted to the downside. Wage growth stagnated and manufacturing payrolls declined for the first time in six months. The retail and utilities sectors also continued to shed jobs. The report followed a string of weak economic reports, including a plunge in manufacturing activity to more than a 10-year low in September and a sharp slowdown in services industry growth to levels last seen in 2016, that heightened fears the economy was flirting with a recession. “The unemployment rate usually rises ahead of a recession, so a fresh decline pushes out the timeline for any potential recession into late 2020 at the earliest,” said Josh Wright, chief economist at iCIMS in New York. The two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 3.7% in August pushed it to its lowest level since December 1969. The jobless rate, which had been stuck at 3.7% for three straight months, declined even as 117,000 people entered the labor force last month. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 jobs last month, the government’s survey of establishments showed. The economy created 45,000 more jobs in July and August than previously estimated. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would increase by 145,000 jobs in September. September’s job gains were below the monthly average of 161,000 this year, but still above the roughly 100,000 needed each month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The smaller household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived showed a jump of 391,000 in employment in September. With signs that the Trump administration’s 15-month trade war with China is spilling over to the broader economy, continued labor market strength is a critical buffer against an economic downturn. The trade war has eroded business confidence, sinking investment and manufacturing.  There is also political uncertainty in Washington after the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives launched an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump over accusations he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. These factors, together with benign wage inflation, are likely to prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at least one more time this year, economists said. The U.S. central bank cut rates last month after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008, to keep the economic expansion, now in its 11th year, on track.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated on Friday that the economy was “in a good place,” adding that “our job is to keep it there as long as possible.” The dollar .DXY was little changed against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose marginally. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.  “We continue to expect the Fed to cut its target interest rate later this month,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “We believe it would have taken a much stronger number to convince Fed leadership that they have already taken out enough insurance against downside risks.” Economic growth estimates for the third quarter range from as low as a 1.3% annualized rate to as high as a 1.9% pace. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the second quarter, slowing from a 3.1% rate in the January-March period.  Slower growth was reinforced by a report from the Commerce Department on Friday that showed the U.S. trade deficit widened 1.6% to $54.9 billion in August. A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, declined to 6.9% last month, the lowest level since December 2000, from 7.2% in August. Despite the tight labor market, average hourly earnings were unchanged last month after advancing 0.4% in August. That lowered the annual increase in wages to 2.9% from 3.2% in August. The average workweek was unchanged at 34.4 hours.  Some economists believe wage growth is stalling because companies are hiring inexperienced workers in the face of labor shortages. Others blame the slowdown on ebbing demand for workers. “With demand for labor softening and many companies contending with higher input costs as the trade war lingers and broadens, we do not expect to see any meaningful strengthening in wage growth in the coming months,” said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Hiring is slowing across all sectors, with the exception of government, which is being boosted by state and local government recruitment. Private payrolls increased by 114,000 jobs in September after rising by 122,000 in August.  The three-month average gain in private employment fell to 119,000, the smallest since July 2012, from 135,000 in August.  Manufacturing shed 2,000 jobs last month, the first decline in factory payrolls since March, after a gain of 2,000 jobs in August. Manufacturing has ironically borne the brunt of the Trump administration’s trade war, which the White House has argued is intended to boost the sector.  Last month’s decline in manufacturing payrolls was led by the automotive sector, which lost 4,100 jobs. Further losses are likely if a strike by General Motors (GM.N) workers continues.  Construction employment increased by 7,000 jobs after rising by 4,000 in August. Retail payrolls fell by 11,400 jobs, marking an eighth straight monthly drop. Government employment increased by 22,000 jobs in September after surging by 46,000 in August. Hiring was boosted by state and local governments. Only 1,000 workers were hired last month for the 2020 Census. Government payrolls have increased by 147,000 over the year, driven by local governments.

The House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, which is seeking the testimony from Facebook executives, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The panel’s plans were first reported by The Information technology news website. Facebook shocked regulators and lawmakers with its announcement in June that it was hoping to launch a digital coin called Libra in 2020. Policymakers and financial watchdogs at home and abroad are concerned about the effect of widespread adoption of Libra by the social media company’s 2.38 billion users on the global financial system. “Facebook’s plans raise serious privacy, trading, national security, and monetary policy concerns, not only for Facebook’s over 2 billion users, who will have immediate access to these products, but also for consumers, investors and the global economy,” House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters said at a hearing on Libra in July.

1204,"LONDON   - The Scottish government said on Thursday that the imposition of U.S. tariffs on various goods including Scottish whisky indicated that the United Kingdom could not offset the damage from Brexit by striking a trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump. “When Scotland’s food and drink businesses are facing the potential impact of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, the last thing they need is the further uncertainty of increased tariffs on exports to U.S.,” a Scottish government spokesman said. “The imposition of these tariffs also seriously undermines suggestions by the UK government that a potential free trade deal with the United States could easily or quickly offset the damage done by Brexit,” the spokesman said. The United States is the largest export market for Scotch Whisky, Scotland said. The United States on Wednesday said it would slap 10% tariffs on European-made Airbus (AIR.PA) planes and 25% duties on French wine, Scotch whiskies, and cheese from across the continent as punishment for illegal EU aircraft subsidies. “While this news is deeply concerning for Scotch Whisky and other Scottish products exported to the U.S., we still hope that Scottish exports will not become collateral damage in this trade dispute and support the EU’s ongoing work towards a negotiated settlement with the U.S.,” the spokesman said. “We have made our concerns about the impact on whisky and other Scottish produce clear to UK ministers, and expect them to do all they can to protect Scottish exports,” he said.  “We will continue to work with key partners, including the Scotch Whisky Association, to support the industry and minimize potential tariffs.” ",Scotland says U.S. tariff move shows UK's Brexit pipe dream,"October 3, 2019 /  11:59 AM ",london the scottish government said on thursday that the imposition of u s tariffs on various goods including scottish whisky indicated that the united kingdom could not offset the damage from brexit by striking a trade deal with u s president donald trump when scotland s food and drink businesses are facing the potential impact of a no deal brexit the last thing they need is the further uncertainty of increased tariffs on exports to u s a scottish government spokesman said the imposition of these tariffs also seriously undermines suggestions by the uk government that a potential free trade deal with the united states could easily or quickly offset the damage done by brexit the spokesman said the united states is the largest export market for scotch whisky scotland said the united states on wednesday said it would slap  tariffs on european made airbus air pa planes and  duties on french wine scotch whiskies and cheese from across the continent as punishment for illegal eu aircraft subsidies while this news is deeply concerning for scotch whisky and other scottish products exported to the u s we still hope that scottish exports will not become collateral damage in this trade dispute and support the eu s ongoing work towards a negotiated settlement with the u s the spokesman said we have made our concerns about the impact on whisky and other scottish produce clear to uk ministers and expect them to do all they can to protect scottish exports he said we will continue to work with key partners including the scotch whisky association to support the industry and minimize potential tariffs ,Brexit,0.2134483903646469
1218,"LONDON   - A move by the United States to slap a 25% tariff on single malt Scotch whisky will damage the industry and hurt jobs and investment in Scotland, the sector’s trade association said on Thursday, as it urged restraint on all sides.  Washington on Wednesday said it would slap 10% tariffs on European-made Airbus (AIR.PA) planes and 25% duties on a range of products including French wine, Scotch whiskies and cheese from across the continent as punishment for illegal EU aircraft subsidies. The United States is Scotch whisky’s largest and most valuable single market, with over 1 billion pounds of the product being exported there last year.  The association said despite the issue being over aircraft subsidies, single-malt whisky represented over half of the total value of UK products on the U.S. tariff list, amounting to over $460 million.  “The tariff will undoubtedly damage the Scotch Whisky sector,” Scotch Whisky Association Chief Executive Karen Betts said in a statement. “The tariff will put our competitiveness and Scotch Whisky’s market share at risk,” she said. “We expect to see a negative impact on investment and job creation in Scotland, and longer term impacts on productivity and growth across the industry and our supply chain.”   Betts urged the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom to de-escalate the trade dispute, adding that exports going both ways between Britain and the United States had grown strongly over the last 25 years when there were no tariffs on spirits.

1272,"LONDON   - Tesco (TSCO.L) boss Dave Lewis, credited with saving Britain’s biggest retailer from collapse in 2014, will step down next summer after declaring its turnaround complete, handing over to a relative unknown catapulted into one of the sector’s top jobs. Celebrating its 100th anniversary, Tesco is five years into a recovery plan launched by Lewis after an accounting scandal capped a dramatic downturn in trading. Successor Ken Murphy, a former executive at healthcare group Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O), will become the second outsider to lead Tesco, following in the footsteps of former Unilever (ULVR.L) executive Lewis.     Like Lewis, 52-year-old Irish national Murphy has experience in the consumer goods industry, key suppliers to supermarkets, having started his career at Procter & Gamble (PG.N). “Now is the right time for me to pass on the baton; our turnaround is complete,” Lewis told reporters on Wednesday. “We’ve delivered all the metrics we set for ourselves, the leadership team is very strong, our strategy is clear and it is delivering,” he said, adding that he was not leaving for another job. The outgoing boss also dismissed Murphy’s lack of experience in the UK grocery retail industry, another parallel with Lewis at the start of his Tesco tenure. “If you look at the CEO as being the best shopkeeper in the team, it’s the wrong brief,” Lewis said. “He’s got loads of retail experience, he’s got loads of wholesale experience, he understands brands and he understands customers and he’s super smart.” News of Lewis’s departure came as Tesco beat forecasts with a 25% rise in first-half operating profit before one-off items of 1.4 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) and raised its interim dividend by 58.7%. The numbers served as a clear demonstration of the progress made since Lewis launched his recovery plan after a 2014 accounting scandal capped a dramatic downturn in trading. Shares in the group were up 0.2% at 1511 GMT. Tesco was on its knees when Lewis joined but has since met all his turnaround goals, including a key margin target of earning between 3.5 pence and 4 pence of profit for every pound customers spend. The first-half profit margin was 3.67%. “Put quite simply he is the bloke that saved Tesco, which should go down as an enormous achievement in British retail history,” said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.  “Murphy has big shoes to fill.” Shares in Tesco, which has a 27.4% share of Britain’s grocery market, have risen 6% since Lewis started in September 2014. The FTSE 100 index, meanwhile, has risen by 8.5%. Lewis, however, noted that Tesco’s shares had risen by about 40% since the full extent of the accounting irregularities were revealed in October 2014. Lewis overhauled Tesco’s relationship with suppliers, lowered prices, simplified product ranges and improved store standards. Jobs have also been cut, including 4,500 announced in August. The 54-year-old also pursued growth by buying wholesaler Booker for nearly 4 billion pounds, forming a global purchasing alliance with Carrefour (CARR.PA) and launching discount format Jack’s. Tesco chairman John Allan said Lewis had told him about his planned 2020 departure a year ago, kicking off a succession process that also considered internal candidates. Allan said that Charles Wilson, the Booker boss once seen as the frontrunner to succeed Lewis, did not want to be considered. Murphy ticks a lot of boxes for Tesco. He led the turnaround of Alliance UniChem in Italy, then shared the top operations job at Boots UK & Ireland before going on to become executive vice president, chief commercial officer and president of global brands at Walgreens Boots Alliance. Murphy left that position at the end of 2018, retaining a consultancy role with the U.S. retailer. “We wanted a combination of experience, proven leadership in international retail businesses, a strong strategic mind and a track record in commercial and brand,” Allan said. He denied that Murphy’s appointment signaled a new international push from Tesco, which has retrenched from countries such as South Korea and Turkey under Lewis. Given contractual commitments to Walgreens, Murphy’s precise start date will be announced in due course. He will join on a basic annual salary of 1.35 million pounds, slightly less than the 1.25 million pounds Lewis earned in 2018-19.      Tesco is also stepping up its store opening program, doubling its UK online capacity and revamping its Clubcard loyalty scheme. It is also buying wholesaler Best Food Logistics. Though Tesco said it has made a strong start to the year, UK like-for-like sales dipped 1% in its second quarter, partly reflecting a tough comparison with the same period last year,  when a heatwave and the men’s soccer World Cup boosted demand. Lewis said that being CEO of Tesco was “all consuming” and when he leaves he would take time out with his family before considering his next move. He said he did not want to be labeled as the man who saved Tesco, insisting “there are 450,000 people who have turned around the business”.

1682,"LONDON/NEW YORK   - Bitcoin struggled on Wednesday to recover from the three-month lows it reached a day earlier, moves that traders blamed on a lukewarm reception for a futures product from the owner of the New York Stock Exchange.  Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell 2% to $8,364 in early trading. It plunged as much as 15% on Tuesday, briefly breaching $8,000, in its biggest one-day drop since July 16, before recovering some of its losses. The Intercontinental Exchange, the NYSE owner, listed its Bakkt bitcoin futures on Monday, which many crypto enthusiasts expected would lead to an influx of money from larger investors.  The opening of Bakkt, ICE’s bitcoin futures platform, was regularly cited for bitcoin’s steep gains earlier in the year. Bakkt said 166 contracts traded hands on Tuesday — unimpressive volume, analysts and traders said. Some interpreted the tepid take-up as evidence of continued hesitation toward cryptocurrencies from larger investors. “It’s one thing to give institutional money access to BTC (bitcoin),” said Jamie Farquhar, portfolio manager at crypto firm NKB Group in London. “It’s another thing to make them comfortable enough to actually buy it.” Bitcoin futures offered by exchanges regulated in financial centers have boomed this year, partly driven by investors seeking exposure to crypto but seeking protection from the heists, hacks and volatility that have plagued the emerging sector. Some of the exchanges offering bitcoin futures are also planning to introduce more complex derivatives, offering traders another way to hedge their risk in the cryptocurrency. CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange operator, is planning to launch options on its bitcoin futures contracts in the first quarter of 2020.     Some market players said bitcoin’s fall on Tuesday was also partly caused by technical factors - often a big catalyst for price moves in an emerging asset plagued by poor price discovery and lacking in fundamentals. Bitcoin has been on a downward trend in recent weeks, plunging about 35% since early August. A highly skeptical response by regulators and politicians to Libra, Facebook’s planned cryptocurrency, was one reason for the decline.

1977,"MIAMI   - Presidential candidate Kamala Harris dominated her Democratic rivals in a debate on Thursday, confronting front-runner Joe Biden on race and calling his remarks about working with segregationist senators “hurtful.”     In a breakout performance, the daughter of a black father from Jamaica and an Indian mother was at the center of several heated exchanges during the second night of debates among Democrats vying for the right to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the 2020 election.     Harris said the issue of race was deeply personal for her. She noted she was bused to school as part of integration efforts in California, and she questioned Biden’s 1970s opposition to school busing.     The former prosecutor looked straight at Biden and demanded that he explain himself.     “I do not believe you are a racist. And I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground,” said Harris, 54, a U.S. senator from California who has ranked fourth or fifth in most national polls among Democrats.      “But I also believe - and it’s personal and it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.”         Biden, who was on the defensive throughout the night, has faced heavy criticism for his recent comments that he worked decades ago with two Southern segregationist senators as a way to get things done in the U.S. Senate.     He appeared shaken by the attack, but defended his record on civil rights and said his remarks had been mischaracterized as praise for racists.     “If we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether I did or not, I’m happy to do that,” he said, noting he had only opposed busing for school integration ordered by the federal government, not by local governments.     “Everything I have done in my career, I ran because of civil rights and continue to think we have to make fundamental changes,” he said.     He added a dig at Harris, noting he had been a public defender and “didn’t become a prosecutor.”     One of the lesser-known candidates, U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell, 38, also took a swing at Biden, sharply reminding voters of Biden’s age and urging the 76-year-old to pass the torch to younger candidates.     “I was 6 years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic convention and said it’s time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans,” Swalwell said. “That candidate was then-Senator Joe Biden.”     “He was right when he said that 32 years ago. He is still right today,” Swalwell said.     Biden responded: “I’m still holding onto that torch. I want to make it clear.”     In a Democratic contest where racial issues have figured prominently, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, also faced pointed questions about accusations of racism inside his city’s predominantly white police force after a fatal police shooting of a black man.     The contenders frequently attacked Trump and sharply disagreed over the best way to boost access to healthcare insurance coverage. Biden and the candidate running second in polls among Democrats, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, turned their fire on Trump repeatedly.     “The American people understand that Trump is a phony, that Trump is a pathological liar and a racist and that he lied to the American people during his campaign,” said Sanders, who was relegated to the sidelines for much of the night.     Biden, the former vice president making his third run for the White House, said Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy and other economic policies were increasing economic inequality in the United States.     “Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation. We do have enormous income inequality,” Biden said. “The one thing I agree on is we can make massive cuts in the $1.6 trillion in tax loopholes out there, and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy.”     The debate also included U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and Kirsten Gillibrand, former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper,  self-help guru Marianne Williamson and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. All six are polling nationally around 1% or less.          Like the Democrats who debated on Wednesday, the contenders disagreed on the best way to expand healthcare coverage.

","In breakout debate performance, Harris challenges Biden on race","June 28, 2019 /  10:07 AM ",miami presidential candidate kamala harris dominated her democratic rivals in a debate on thursday confronting front runner joe biden on race and calling his remarks about working with segregationist senators hurtful in a breakout performance the daughter of a black father from jamaica and an indian mother was at the center of several heated exchanges during the second night of debates among democrats vying for the right to challenge republican president donald trump in the  election harris said the issue of race was deeply personal for her she noted she was bused to school as part of integration efforts in california and she questioned biden s s opposition to school busing the former prosecutor looked straight at biden and demanded that he explain himself i do not believe you are a racist and i agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground said harris  a u s senator from california who has ranked fourth or fifth in most national polls among democrats but i also believe and it s personal and it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two united states senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country biden who was on the defensive throughout the night has faced heavy criticism for his recent comments that he worked decades ago with two southern segregationist senators as a way to get things done in the u s senate he appeared shaken by the attack but defended his record on civil rights and said his remarks had been mischaracterized as praise for racists if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether i did or not i m happy to do that he said noting he had only opposed busing for school integration ordered by the federal government not by local governments everything i have done in my career i ran because of civil rights and continue to think we have to make fundamental changes he said he added a dig at harris noting he had been a public defender and didn t become a prosecutor one of the lesser known candidates u s representative eric swalwell  also took a swing at biden sharply reminding voters of biden s age and urging the  year old to pass the torch to younger candidates i was  years old when a presidential candidate came to the california democratic convention and said it s time to pass the torch to a new generation of americans swalwell said that candidate was then senator joe biden he was right when he said that  years ago he is still right today swalwell said biden responded i m still holding onto that torch i want to make it clear in a democratic contest where racial issues have figured prominently mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana also faced pointed questions about accusations of racism inside his city s predominantly white police force after a fatal police shooting of a black man the contenders frequently attacked trump and sharply disagreed over the best way to boost access to healthcare insurance coverage biden and the candidate running second in polls among democrats senator bernie sanders of vermont turned their fire on trump repeatedly the american people understand that trump is a phony that trump is a pathological liar and a racist and that he lied to the american people during his campaign said sanders who was relegated to the sidelines for much of the night biden the former vice president making his third run for the white house said trump s tax cuts for the wealthy and other economic policies were increasing economic inequality in the united states donald trump has put us in a horrible situation we do have enormous income inequality biden said the one thing i agree on is we can make massive cuts in the   trillion in tax loopholes out there and i would be going about eliminating donald trump s tax cuts for the wealthy the debate

2473,"SEATTLE/PARIS   - The head of Nissan Motor Co’s (7201.T) China business and an executive tasked with leading its revival have emerged as two of the top candidates to take over as the next CEO of the troubled Japanese automaker, four people familiar with the matter said. Discussions are still underway and nothing has been decided, said the people, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity. There is also a possibility that another candidate could still be successful, with temporary Chief Executive Yasuhiro Yamauchi seen as one possibility, according to two sources.   The appointment of Nissan’s next CEO in October will have vast implications for both the future of Japan’s second-largest automaker and its strained alliance with top shareholder Renault SA (RENA.PA). The next leader could push for deeper ties with Renault or greater independence from it. Two of the top candidates are Makoto Uchida, in charge of Nissan’s operations in China, its biggest market, and Jun Seki, who previously headed the China business and is now spearheading an internal team charged with Nissan’s recovery. Uchida, who has worked on purchasing for the alliance, is seen as being favored by Renault and Renault-friendly members of Nissan’s board, while Seki is preferred by those from the Nissan side, two of the people familiar with the matter said.   “Renault is much more familiar with Uchida,” one of the people, a Nissan insider, said. “The Renault side thinks Uchida is much easier to control than Seki.” Nissan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Other board members are throwing their weight behind Seki, partially due to politics but also because he is seen as having more well rounded experience as an auto executive, the two said. “Seki is much more personable and well liked within Nissan and trusted by his peers and those under him,” the Nissan insider said. The nominations committee, which includes board members, is considering the candidates from a list of around 10, according to another person familiar with the deliberations. The board will ultimately vote on the next CEO.  “Given the short lead time, the next CEO most likely wouldn’t be someone too far from the existing power structure,” said Andre Lindeque, representative director of Turnpoint Consulting, an automotive recruiting agency in Tokyo. “The focus on improved corporate governance may allow them the leeway to elevate someone who does not pose too much disruption to the leadership team.” Nissan said this week that Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa will resign on Sept. 16, bowing to pressure after he admitted to being improperly overpaid by around $440,000. It marks more  upheaval at a company battered by a plunge in profit and the dramatic arrest of former chairman Carlos Ghosn last year.  Yamauchi will take over as temporary chief executive and the nominations committee has said it wants a permanent replacement appointed by the end of October. Yamauchi is also seen as possible candidate especially if the board wants to stress continuity, two sources said.  Nissan managers favor Yamauchi, one of the people said. Yamauchi, 63, is widely seen as a bridge between the alliance partners, and the near four-decade Nissan veteran is known to be well-regarded at Renault where he serves as a board member.

2645,"WASHINGTON   - Representatives from more than 70 companies met with U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday to push for a tax on carbon emissions to fight climate change, and a senator said bipartisan legislation containing such a plan could be introduced in weeks.    The gathering, which included PepsiCo, Johnson & Johnson, Tesla and General Mills, was the largest business group in a decade to advocate at the Capitol for climate legislation.  The companies were seeking to be heard as lawmakers consider more aggressive plans to tackle climate change.  Most of the Democratic candidates in the 2020 presidential election including Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren have embraced the Green New Deal, a set of policy goals introduced by congressional Democrats to transform the energy system to 100% renewable sources by 2030, using federal funds to invest in infrastructure and green jobs.   Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat, told reporters after hosting one of the meetings on a carbon tax with about six representatives of companies and lawmakers from both parties that a price on carbon has been widely recognized as “the single most important lever we can pull” to fight climate change.   Coons said he hopes to introduce a bipartisan bill in weeks to put a fee on carbon. A similar bill that would return a dividend on the carbon fee revenues to taxpayers has been introduced in the House.       Michelle Patron, a sustainability director at Microsoft, said her company had taken voluntary steps including an internal carbon tax but that business could not do everything.  “But no matter how much any one company does, federal policy is needed to drive large-scale change,” Patron said. Carbon fees face an uphill battle as no Republicans in the Senate publicly support the idea yet. Some Republicans, such as Senator Lamar Alexander, back legislation to boost innovation in nuclear power, batteries, natural gas technology and renewable energy.  Companies pushing for the carbon tax included BP and Shell which earlier this week each donated $1 million to the Americans for Carbon Dividends political action committee of the Climate Leadership Council.  The PAC has embraced a proposal by Republicans, including former secretaries of state James Baker and George Shultz, for a carbon tax returning revenues to consumers. The plan is for an initial $40-a-ton tax on carbon dioxide that would increase over time. Companies contributing to that group have faced criticism from environmentalists that the plan calls for a reduction in U.S. regulations on climate pollution and for companies to be shielded from some lawsuits over climate change.  BP and Shell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Coons said while businesses seek what is in their own best interests, it does not mean they are not honestly trying to participate in a process that could have benefits for the climate.  “If they are part of a multi-industry, multi-company effort to press for a carbon tax ... that will hopefully have an impact on the most significant resistance politically in Congress to a carbon fee,” Coons said.

2740,"TOKYO   - Nissan Motor Co was embroiled in another scandal over executive pay on Thursday after Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa admitted to being overpaid in violation of internal procedures under a scheme designed by ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn. An internal investigation found that Saikawa and other executives had received improper compensation, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, raising doubts about Saikawa’s pledge to improve governance in the wake of Ghosn’s arrest last year for alleged financial misconduct. Saikawa apologized and vowed to return any improperly paid funds as he admitted to Japanese reporters earlier on Thursday that he had wrongly received stock-related compensation under “a scheme of the Ghosn era”.  “I am deeply sorry for causing concern,” Saikawa said, according to Jiji Press. In other comments reported by Kyodo news, Saikawa denied any direct role in the execution of a stock appreciation rights (SAR) scheme and said he thought “proper procedures” had been taken. The improper payments, including tens of millions of yen Saikawa received through the SAR scheme, were disclosed on Wednesday at a meeting of Nissan’s audit committee, said the source who declined to be identified because the information is not public. Disciplinary action regarding the issue would be discussed at an upcoming board meeting, the source added. Nissan said in a statement that the findings from its probe including issues related to the share appreciation rights would be submitted to its board on Sept. 9. The company has been trying to strengthen governance, slash costs and boost flagging profitability amid persistent allegations of financial misconduct stemming from Ghosn’s 20-year reign at Japan’s second-biggest automaker. Ghosn is awaiting trial in Japan over charges including enriching himself at a cost of $5 million to Nissan. Kyodo reported that proceedings could start as early as March. He denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a boardroom coup. Confidence in Saikawa had already been shaken by accusations he was too close to Ghosn, whose arrest in November rocked the global auto industry and exposed tensions in the automaking partnership between Nissan and Renault SA. The company launched its internal investigation after Japanese magazine Bungei Shunju in June published accusations by former director Greg Kelly that Saikawa was granted an exception in 2013 to reschedule a stock-linked bonus that bumped up the payout by 47 million yen ($445,962). Like Ghosn, Kelly is awaiting trial on charges of financial misconduct which he denies. The latest compensation issue could exacerbate tensions with top shareholder Renault, after a failed attempt by the French automaker to secure a full merger with Nissan and to combine Renault with Fiat Chrysler (FCA). Saikawa opposed both plans. Renault spokesman Frederic Texier declined to comment on the issue on Thursday. But a source close the company said Renault would “respect Nissan’s governance” and leave the board to consider its response. The alliance partners are discussing reforms that could win Nissan’s support for a renewed FCA-Renault tie-up, including a potential reduction to Renault’s 43.4% stake in Nissan. Saikawa was re-appointed by shareholders with the lowest approval rating among the 11 directors in June.

2751,"Chicago   - Tesla Inc’s (TSLA.O) use of individual customer data, such as vehicle camera footage and GPS, to price its new insurance products will depend on drivers’ authorization and individual U.S. state laws, a senior company executive said on Wednesday. “The data is there, it’s all there, cameras in and all around your car, all of the data points are there,” Matthew  Edmonds, Tesla’s Head of Insurance, said at an auto insurance conference in Chicago. “It really comes down to case law, and how much of the data we can utilize. It would have to be a state-by-state proposition,” Edmonds said. Tesla last week said it was launching an insurance service designed to give drivers in California, its biggest market, lower rates because of safety features on its electric vehicles. The company did not name an insurance partner, but the California Department of Insurance website showed Tesla was  licensed as a broker to conduct business on behalf of the State National Insurance Company Inc, a unit of Markel Corp (MKL.N). Chief Executive Elon Musk has been one of the strongest proponents of the idea that car insurance rates should plummet as driver-assist and self-driving technology become standard.  U.S. insurers say they currently do not have sufficient data to validate auto industry promises of safety benefits from automated driving systems, citing automakers’ reluctance to provide detailed information on models sold with those features, a lack of consistent standards, drivers’ unpredictable use of the systems and higher repair costs. Tesla is one of the few manufacturers whose vehicles are largely standard-equipped with advanced driver assistance features, including cameras monitoring lane keeping and recording vehicle surroundings. California regulatory insurance filings in May said Tesla’s insurance product might use “direct data feeds with customer permission.” But Tesla’s insurance website states it uses “anonymized, aggregate data” to inform insurance rates, adding that it does not currently use data from individual vehicles, such as GPS or video footage.

2758,"NEW YORK   - New York City sued T-Mobile USA Inc on Wednesday, accusing the fourth-largest U.S. mobile phone company of engaging in “rampant” sales abuses of customers for its lower-priced, prepaid wireless brand, Metro by T-Mobile. In a complaint filed in the state supreme court in Manhattan, the city said it had identified more than 2,200 violations by T-Mobile, whose “pervasive” illegal activity spanned 56 Metro stores in all five boroughs, including authorized dealers and stores run by its MetroPCS NY unit. T-Mobile, a unit of Deutsche Telekom AG, declined immediate comment. Spokespeople for the city’s law department and Consumer Affairs Commissioner Lorelei Salas did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit was filed as T-Mobile tries to win necessary approvals to merge with Sprint Corp, the No. 3 U.S. mobile phone company. Sixteen U.S. states, led by New York and California, and Washington, D.C. have sued to block the merger, which they say will boost costs for consumers by reducing competition. In its complaint, New York City said it had evidence that many Metro stores sold used or reconditioned phones as new, and charged taxes that were excessive or appeared to be “made up,” including “device change taxes” and “device activation taxes.” It also accused T-Mobile of partnering with third parties to enroll unsuspecting consumers in expensive financing plans without their consent. The complaint cited one example in which a woman thought she had bought a phone advertised at $599 from a Bronx dealer, only to learn later that she had signed up for a 12-month lease costing $2,191.30. New York City also said the website of Metro by T-Mobile deceptively advertised a “30 day guarantee” on phone purchases, though the fine print said the guarantee was just seven days and covered only a “small sub-category” of transactions. The lawsuit seeks to recoup overcharges, and impose civil fines of $350 to $500 per violation, among other remedies.

2914,"WASHINGTON   - Congressional Democrats moved closer on Monday to citing Attorney General William Barr for contempt of Congress over his failure to give them an unredacted version of the Mueller report, escalating a showdown with the White House. The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee released a report citing Barr, an appointee of President Donald Trump, for contempt of Congress after the expiration of a second deadline to produce the full report. Barr also skipped a hearing before the committee last week.             The panel will vote on whether to move ahead with a contempt citation on Wednesday, and if it does so, the full House will vote on the issue.  Barr has released a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report here on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler subpoenaed the full document and underlying evidence, setting an initial deadline that Barr missed last week. Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said he was disappointed with the committee’s contempt move and invited committee staff to the Justice Department to discuss a possible compromise on Wednesday afternoon, after the committee’s expected vote. Later, Nadler said in a statement that Justice Department officials had agreed to shift the meeting to Tuesday. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Trump administration is stonewalling multiple probes by House committees.  A contempt citation could lead to a civil court case against Barr, raising the possibility of fines and even imprisonment for failure to comply. Some Democrats on Nadler’s panel say lawmakers could also exercise their own little-used “inherent” authority to act outside the U.S. judicial system to apprehend, fine and even imprison officials who do not comply with congressional subpoenas. “The attorney general’s failure to comply with our subpoena ... leaves us no choice but to initiate contempt proceedings,” Nadler said in a statement. But he held out the possibility that Barr could avoid contempt by making a “good faith” offer for access to the material. Republicans reject Nadler’s efforts as political theater, which they say is intended to satisfy the Democrats’ voters. “Democrats have launched a proxy war smearing the attorney general when their anger actually lies with the president and the special counsel, who found neither conspiracy nor obstruction,” Representative Doug Collins, top Republican on the committee, said in a statement.   Some Democrats have called on Barr to resign, accusing him of protecting Trump by effectively clearing the president of criminal obstruction of justice and excusing actions viewed by them as evidence of misconduct. Nadler’s committee views the full Mueller report as vital to its own corruption and obstruction of justice investigation of Trump. The chairs of five other House committees investigating the president have also called for its release.         The Mueller report details extensive contacts between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Moscow, but did not find that there was a conspiracy between Moscow and the campaign. The report also describes actions Trump took to try to impede Mueller’s investigation.      If lawmakers established that Trump obstructed justice by seeking to impede Mueller, Nadler’s panel could move to impeachment proceedings against the president. Trump denied any wrongdoing in a tweet on Monday. “Also, there are ‘No High Crimes & Misdemeanors,’ No Collusion, No Conspiracy, No Obstruction. ALL THE CRIMES ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE, and that’s what the Dems should be looking at, but they won’t. Nevertheless, the tables are turning!” the president wrote on Twitter.

3165,"  - Amgen Inc will buy Celgene Corp’s psoriasis drug Otezla for $13.4 billion in cash, clearing the way for Bristol-Myers Squibb to go ahead with its $74 billion deal for Celgene by the end of the year. Amgen, which announced the deal on Monday, is paying a hefty price for the drug, according to analysts and investors. Still, Otezla, which brought in sales of $1.61 billion last year, will deliver growth for Amgen right away, and its shares rose around 3 percent in afternoon trading. Bristol-Myers and Celgene’s shares were both also up around 3 percent. New York-based Bristol-Myers said in June that it would sell Otezla to allay concerns raised by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission because of a competing treatment that it is developing. Analysts said at the time that they were expecting Otezla to sell for around $8 billion to $10 billion. Bristol-Myers said in a statement that there was significant interest from multiple potential buyers from early on in the process. Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen said that it expects Otezla’s sales to grow at least in the low-double digits over the next five years. It also said it expects the drug’s patents to protect its exclusivity in the United States until 2028. For an interactive on Otezla sales click: here Jeff Jonas, healthcare portfolio manager at Gabelli funds, said that a number of Amgen’s current drugs face loss of patent protection and competition from biosimilar drugs, so the growth from Otezla would be welcome. “This is an attractive product for them that fits more or less with their current portfolio,” Jonas said. “It’s an approved product with a good safety profile, so there’s not a lot of risk.” Still, Jonas expressed some skepticism about Amgen’s growth forecast for the drug, noting that new competitors, including Bristol-Myers’ drug in development, are likely to eat into its market share. Amgen said it expects the deal to produce tax benefits with a present cash value of $2.2 billion, reducing the actual deal total to $11.2 billion. With respect to possible antitrust concerns about the purchase, Amgen said on a conference call that it feels very confident that it will be able to close the deal. Bristol-Myers said most of the proceeds from the sale will go to pay down debt from the deal with Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene. It also increased a previously planned $5 billion accelerated share buyback to $7 billion.

3166,"NEW YORK   - Oil prices fell 1% on Monday on the outlook for increased supply of Iranian crude after France’s president lifted hopes for a deal between Washington and Tehran, but losses were limited by optimism surrounding a U.S.-China trade deal. Brent crude lost 64 cents, or 1.1%, to settle at $58.70 a barrel, after hitting a session high of $60.17. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled 53 cents, or 1%, lower at $53.64 a barrel. Prices fell after French President Emmanuel Macron said preparations were underway for a meeting between Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and U.S. President Donald Trump in the coming weeks to find a solution to a nuclear standoff.   Trump last year abandoned Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, arguing that he wanted a bigger deal that not only limited Iran’s atomic work, but also reined in its support for proxies in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon, and curbed its ballistic missile program. Trump also tightened sanctions on Iran in May to try to choke off its oil exports.   “Now the market is pondering the possibility that we’ll see a flood or Iranian oil come onto the market if there’s progress made,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “We have to be admittedly cautious because we’ve heard of deals one minute only to be tweeted down the next minute.” Buoying prices, Trump said after a G7 summit of world leaders in Biarritz, France, that he believed China was sincere about wanting to reach a deal. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who has been leading the talks with Washington, said China was willing to resolve the dispute through “calm” negotiations and opposed any increase in trade tensions. Oil prices have fallen about 20% from a 2019 high reached in April in part because of worries that the U.S.-China trade conflict is hurting the global economy, which could dent demand for oil. China’s Commerce Ministry said last week it would impose additional tariffs of 5% or 10% on a total of 5,078 products originating from the United States, including crude oil, agricultural products and small aircraft. In retaliation, Trump said he was ordering U.S. companies to look at ways to close operations in China and make products in the United States. “We are maintaining a market view that includes continued high-pitched price volatility that will be driven largely by headlines related to U.S.-China trade talks or lack thereof,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.

3258,"BUENOS AIRES   - It happened in 1989. It happened in 2002. Argentines who are old enough to remember do not want to go through it again. A run on the peso since the Aug. 11 primary election, which signaled that business-friendly President Mauricio Macri likely will not get re-elected, shocked Argentines who remember being blocked from withdrawing their money in past “corralitos,” a local term that means banks retain cash in “little corrals.” There has been no sign of a new corralito. But in the past week, dollar deposits fell by $1.9 billion, or 6% of the $30.5 billion in total dollar deposits, according to central bank data on Friday. The impulse for depositors to grab cash while they can stems from a history of mistrust in the banking system. Argentina’s market volatility following the primary vote sparked nightmares of the widespread panic during the corralito, when the government froze deposits of $40 billion and imposed caps on the withdrawal of cash from banks, from the end of 2001 through 2002. Riots broke out. Irate depositors vandalized ATMs and supermarkets were looted. The 2001/02 deposits freeze punctuated an economic meltdown that tossed millions of middle-class Argentines into poverty.  GRAPHIC: Argentine deposits in dollars in private sector - here  Argentines had also lost control of their own money in 1989, when deposits were confiscated in exchange for government bonds after banks could not pay interest. Last week, stock and bond prices plummeted and the peso weakened 18% after the landslide victory in the primary election by opposition candidate Alberto Fernandez and his running mate, former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Investors see the pair as a riskier prospect than Macri, due in part to the interventionist policies under Kirchner’s government, including heavy-handed currency controls.  “I prefer to have my savings at home. It’s my insurance for the next few years and I don’t want any doubts,” Stella, 70, told Reuters. Her last name is withheld to protect her privacy. “We already have experience with ‘corralitos,’” she said.  Because the major political parties had already chosen their candidates, the Aug. 11 primary served as a giant opinion poll on the Oct. 27 presidential election. Fernandez surpassed the 45% vote margin needed to win in the first round of voting. Whether the election is decided in October or in a November run-off vote, the next president will take office in December. Private savings, measured as a percentage of gross domestic product in local currency, have decreased to 12% so far this year from 14% in 2016.  Foreign currency deposits have grown, however, to 8% of GDP so far this year, compared to 4% in 2016, according to a report by First Capital Group, signaling that Argentines are ditching their pesos for dollars. Whether outflows continue will be based on market fluctuations, which were more stable in recent days, though volatility could return as the Oct. 27 election nears.  “If the days go by and the dollar remains relatively stable, the outflow of deposits will decrease,” said Christian Reos, research manager at Allaria Lesdesma.

3280,"  - The U.S. economy is in a “favorable place” and the Federal Reserve will “act as appropriate” to keep the current economic expansion on track, Fed chair Jerome Powell said on Friday in remarks that gave few clues about whether the central bank will cut interest rates at its next meeting or not. Story:		 * Powell says U.S. economy is in a ‘favorable place,’ Fed will ‘act as appropriate’ * Powell says Fed is working to sustain economy that faces ‘significant risks’   * Powell says U.S. economy is close to both of Fed’s goals * Powell says slowing global growth, trade policy uncertainty, muted inflation weigh on favorable outlook * Powell says premise that healthy U.S. economy needed higher rates was generally borne out * Powell says low inflation, not high inflation, is ‘problem of this era’ STOCKS: S&P 500 .SPX slightly pares loss, last down 0.33% BONDS: U.S. Treasury yields slipped; 2s US2YT=RR at 1.5682%; 10s US10YT=RR at 1.5774%; 2s/10s curve now flatter around 0.8 bps FOREX: The U.S. dollar index .DXY pares slight gains, last off 0.1% MINH TRANG, SENIOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADER, SILICON VALLEY BANK, SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA     “I don’t think there were any surprises. It’s consistent with the sentiment that you saw in the minutes.      “Powell’s comments basically reiterate a lot of what we have been discussing. That the economy is doing relatively well overall, but there are a lot of challenges and headwinds that are coming our way potentially. I think you could read that in the minutes of the last meeting. The rate cut was more or less an insurance cut to kind of forestall some of these potentially significant headwinds even though the economy is overall doing pretty solid.      “There is a disconnect between the expectations of the market and what the messaging from the Fed is. They haven’t really been in sync for a while now.”  NELA RICHARDSON, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, EDWARD JONES, ST. LOUIS “Markets might confuse chair Powell’s comments of today with Draghi’s comments of a few years ago and misinterpret ‘act as appropriate’ with ‘do whatever it takes’. And that’s the risk.” “What I’ve read of the Powell speech has laid out a very dovish framework that may not be met, given what we are seeing in the economy, slight increases in inflation, stronger retail sales. The recent data, except for the manufacturing, don’t really support a strong, aggressive, do-whatever-it-takes monetary stance and yet that’s exactly what the markets are pricing in right now.” GENNADIY GOLDBERG, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK “Powell’s kind of sticking to the tone. It sounds very much like the minutes, he’s presenting the same arguments, he’s speaking for the committee rather than just for himself, it sounds like, and not committing. The one interesting point is he did talk about all the risks that have happened since the July meeting, and that suggests that he is allowing the markets to price in a September move. That’s where the ‘act as appropriate’ language comes in. That tells us that a September cut is probably a go, not that the market was uncertain to begin with. The kind of disappointing part here is that Powell did not commit to easing rates further, given these global uncertainties. So they are going to be taking these cuts one at a time, rather than providing any kind of forward guidance.” RICHARD FRANULOVICH, HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, WESTPAC, NEW YORK    “The headlines seem consistent with a central banker attentive to the risk and prepared to do more to support the expansion and do whatever it takes to underwrite a continuing recovery. I don’t think that’s particularly new or innovative.  That’s what Powell has been saying for some time.  And the reaction in the FX market is pretty muted.      “I don’t really know what the market was thinking would be delivered, but if you’re betting on another two or three cuts, you wouldn’t be dissuaded by this speech based on the headlines. It doesn’t look like he has leapfrogged expectations. I guess he’s cementing an easing bias and he’s prepared to do more as needed.” SEAN SIMKO, HEAD OF GLOBAL INCOME MANAGEMENT, SEI INVESTMENTS, OAKS, PENNSYLVANIA “The markets are not reacting too much right now. The message he is providing is that we will be vigilant and are watching everything that’s developing. The question is whether the market will be comfortable with them, to wait for them to assess the data points and then make judgments whether the rates need to be lower. The economy is growing but we are seeing some slowdown. He hasn’t taken the opportunity to remove expectations about a rate cut next month. The size of the next cut will depend on how the data come out and how the global economy evolves in the next couple of weeks. The message is that they really want to keep this economy going.  “The yield curve is saying the Fed is not doing enough, they are behind the curve. They want the Fed to do 50 basis points. We continue to favor duration. With any backup in yields, we are looking to add exposure. That wall of worries will help flows into U.S. Treasuries. That will keep the 10-year yield in this 1.50-1.75% range, maybe even lower especially if any of those worries on the economy, trade and Brexit intensify.” ",Powell: Fed to act as appropriate to keep

coming our way potentially i think you could read that in the minutes of the last meeting the rate cut was more or less an insurance cut to kind of forestall some of these potentially significant headwinds even though the economy is overall doing pretty solid there is a disconnect between the expectations of the market and what the messaging from the fed is they haven t really been in sync for a while now nela richardson investment strategist edward jones st louis markets might confuse chair powell s comments of today with draghi s comments of a few years ago and misinterpret act as appropriate with do whatever it takes and that s the risk what i ve read of the powell speech has laid out a very dovish framework that may not be met given what we are seeing in the economy slight increases in inflation stronger retail sales the recent data except for the manufacturing don t really support a strong aggressive do whatever it takes monetary stance and yet that s exactly what the markets are pricing in right now gennadiy goldberg interest rate strategist td securities new york powell s kind of sticking to the tone it sounds very much like the minutes he s presenting the same arguments he s speaking for the committee rather than just for himself it sounds like and not committing the one interesting point is he did talk about all the risks that have happened since the july meeting and that suggests that he is allowing the markets to price in a september move that s where the act as appropriate language comes in that tells us that a september cut is probably a go not that the market was uncertain to begin with the kind of disappointing part here is that powell did not commit to easing rates further given these global uncertainties so they are going to be taking these cuts one at a time rather than providing any kind of forward guidance richard franulovich head of fx strategy westpac new york the headlines seem consistent with a central banker attentive to the risk and prepared to do more to support the expansion and do whatever it takes to underwrite a continuing recovery i don t think that s particularly new or innovative that s what powell has been saying for some time and the reaction in the fx market is pretty muted i don t really know what the market was thinking would be delivered but if you re betting on another two or three cuts you wouldn t be dissuaded by this speech based on the headlines it doesn t look like he has leapfrogged expectations i guess he s cementing an easing bias and he s prepared to do more as needed sean simko head of global income management sei investments oaks pennsylvania the markets are not reacting too much right now the message he is providing is that we will be vigilant and are watching everything that s developing the question is whether the market will be comfortable with them to wait for them to assess the data points and then make judgments whether the rates need to be lower the economy is growing but we are seeing some slowdown he hasn t taken the opportunity to remove expectations about a rate cut next month the size of the next cut will depend on how the data come out and how the global economy evolves in the next couple of weeks the message is that they really want to keep this economy going the yield curve is saying the fed is not doing enough they are behind the curve they want the fed to do  basis points we continue to favor duration with any backup in yields we are looking to add exposure that wall of worries will help flows into u s treasuries that will keep the  year yield in this     range maybe even lower especially if any of those worries on the economy trade and brexit intensify ,Brexit,0.21705679595470428
3283,"WASHINGTON   - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes sank more than expected in July, a sign that the housing market continued in low gear despite lower mortgage rates and a strong labor market. The Commerce Department said on Friday new home sales dropped 12.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 635,000 units last month. It was the biggest monthly decline since July 2013. Economists had expected a sales pace of 649,000 units. Concerns about slowing growth, especially tied to trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as weakness in overseas economies are seen encouraging the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September for the second time this year. U.S. stock prices opened lower on Friday but pared losses after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the economy faced significant risks and the U.S. central bank would act as appropriate to keep the economic expansion on track. U.S. interest rate futures pared gains after the release of Powell’s remarks before rising again. The dollar .DXY was largely flat against a basket of currencies.  The government’s data on new home sales tends to be volatile and subject to large revisions. June’s sales pace was revised sharply higher to 728,000 units from the previously reported 646,000 units.  New home sales last month were 4.3% higher than in July 2018. The median new house price was $312,800, down 4.5% from a year earlier. Despite lower mortgage rates and the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years supporting demand for housing, expensive materials and land and labor shortages are constraining builders’ ability to produce more affordable housing. The housing market hit a soft patch last year and has since struggled to gain traction. New home sales in the South, which accounts for more than half of all transactions, dropped 16.1 percent in July. There were 337,000 new homes on the market last month, up 1.2% from June. At July’s sales pace it would take 6.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.5 months in June.

3313,"WASHINGTON   - Wells Fargo & Co will pay the Navajo Nation $6.5 million to settle a lawsuit over “predatory and unlawful practices” by the bank, the Native American tribe said on Thursday.  The Navajo Nation sued Wells Fargo in federal and tribal courts in 2017, alleging the San Francisco-based bank had opened unauthorized accounts for vulnerable tribe members as part of the potentially millions of fake accounts opened by bank employees nationwide.   The settlement “puts other companies on notice that harmful business practices against the Navajo people will not be tolerated,” Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said in the statement, which referred to Wells Fargo’s “long campaign of predatory and unlawful practices.” Wells Fargo said in a statement that the agreement demonstrates the bank’s “commitment to make things right regarding past sales practices issues.” The settlement with the Navajo Nation followed a $575 million deal in 2018 with U.S. states over claims that Wells Fargo opened phony customer accounts and improperly referred and charged customers for financial products. The settlement comes as Wells Fargo continues its attempt to overcome the fallout from its earlier practices. The bank said last year it had “re-established” itself, but has continued to face harsh criticism from politicians and consumer advocates.  The bank has seen two chief executives exit the firm in the wake of the series of scandals, and is still searching for a replacement for former CEO Timothy Sloan, who abruptly stepped down in March.

3360,"  - Walmart Inc (WMT.N) has sued Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), accusing it of “years of gross negligence and failure to live up to industry standards” that led to several fires at its stores with Tesla solar systems. Walmart hired SolarCity to install solar panel systems on at least 244 of its stores. Tesla bought SolarCity in 2016, and Walmart alleges that Tesla did not fix the problems it inherited and was negligent itself. Tesla has not responded to requests for comment or filed a response to the lawsuit. In Walmart’s August 20 filing, though, the U.S. retailer describes its view of how the fight developed over several years. The following is a timeline based on Walmart’s lawsuit: 2010-2016 Walmart signs at least 244 contracts for solar systems with the company later bought by Tesla. August 2012-2017 Tesla solar panels cause fires at Walmart stores in Long Beach, California, Milpitas, California and Lakeside, Colorado. They are not treated as related or systematic problems. March-May 2018 Walmart stores in Beavercreek, Ohio, Denton, Maryland and Indio, California experience roof fires. Hours before the Indio fire started, Tesla had dispatched personnel to the store; Walmart believes this was to attend to a possible alert. Walmart and Tesla begin joint inspections of sites lasting until December 2018. Over the course of Walmart inspections it says it finds hotspots in solar panels’ cracked sheets, compromising electrical insulation. It blames Tesla for failing to properly ‘hire, train and supervise’ its contractors. It found Tesla put wires near sharp points and metal edges, used incorrect connectors that built up heat and failed properly to tighten connectors, used plastic tools with insufficient strength and plumbing tools, and improperly grounded systems, and kept poor records. During inspections, Walmart said, Tesla searched for problems with drones that lacked sufficient resolution to find panel “hotspots” and put tape on hotspots which exacerbated heat buildup. By August 2019, Walmart says it received 29 inspection reports from Tesla itself. Those identified 157 “action items”, 48 of which Tesla characterizes as “reflecting conditions that rendered the sites unsafe or potentially unsafe”. Issues include improper wiring, poor grounding, broken solar panels with ‘hotspots”. May 31-June 1, 2018 Walmart demands Tesla disconnect all of the solar systems, says that agreements materially breached. Tesla responds that it did not breach contract but agrees that it would be “prudent” to disconnect, inspect and fix systems. It subsequently disconnects the systems. November 29, 2018  Walmart discovers a roof fire from a disconnected solar panel system on a store in Yuba City, California, due to sparking wires after insulation degrated. Walmart says Tesla did not inform it about a ground fault alert it received between June 5 and Sept. 11, that year, at the same store. Walmart said such issues revealed Tesla’s “utter incompetence or callousness, or both.”  January 2019 Tesla tells Walmart it has significantly enhanced its inspection protocols and begun a renewed series of site inspections aimed at reconnecting solar systems. July 2019 Walmart concludes that Tesla is not doing what is needed to ensure safety. It sends its second notice of breach of contract and gives it 30 days to fix. Tesla responds to Walmart with what the retailer called “unsubstantiated allegations”, says fires were “regrettable” and that some issues did exist. It says it is willing to satisfy most of the requirements by Walmart. Walmart concludes its plan is “boilerplate” and falls short.  August 2019 Walmart and Tesla trade letters. On Aug 20, Walmart files lawsuit against Tesla in New York State Supreme Court. It says: “Tesla has not reacted with the urgency that one would expect from a company that had installed solar panels that were catching on fire. Far from it: Tesla’s cavalier responses have only confirmed Walmart’s worries that its contractual counterparty is incapable of providing maintenance and inspection services sufficient to ensure the safety of Walmart’s customers, employees, and property”.

3431,"ST PETERSBURG/MOSCOW   - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday commented for the first time on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s completed report into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, saying Moscow had always said it would find nothing. U.S. Attorney General William Barr said in a summary released last month that Mueller had found no evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia in the election. Putin, speaking at an Arctic forum in the Russian city of St Petersburg, said on Friday that Mueller’s findings were predictable for Moscow. “That it (Mueller’s inquiry) would finish in that way - like a mountain giving birth to a mouse as they say - was clear to us in advance. I’ve been telling you this all along.” “We said from the start that this infamous commission of Mr Mueller’s would not find anything because nobody knows this better than us. Russia did not meddle in any elections in the United States. There was no collusion, as Mr Mueller said, between Trump and Russia.”   Putin said the original allegations of collusion were “complete nonsense” that had been invented for domestic U.S. political consumption and as part of what he described as America’s internal political struggle. The U.S. Attorney General told lawmakers on Tuesday that he intends to release the Mueller report to the public within a week. While the Mueller report cleared Trump of colluding with Russia it did not clear Moscow of trying to meddle in the 2016 vote. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia did interfere, with a campaign of email hacking and online propaganda aimed at sowing discord. When asked at the same event whether he wanted to see Trump re-elected next year, Putin declined to express a view, citing a long list of disagreements with the Trump administration and saying that the question of Trump’s possible re-election was purely a matter for the American people. But Putin, who has praised Trump in the past, said he hoped Moscow and Washington would be able to work together to try to resolve their many differences on the international stage once what he described as the U.S. political crisis was over. Putin in July last year said he had wanted Trump to win the 2016 U.S. presidential election because Trump had spoken of wanting to repair U.S.-Russia relations. Overshadowed by the Mueller report and disagreements over everything from Syria to Ukraine, relations between Russia and the United States have in fact got worse under Trump.

3435,"TALLINN   - Estonia’s Bolt, a popular ride-sharing service in Eastern Europe and Africa, on Wednesday launched food delivery service in its home town of Tallinn, the nation’s capital, and said it plans to  roll out Bolt Food this year in South Africa, Latvia and Lithuania as well. Bolt, which until early this year was called Taxify, has grabbed business from Uber mostly in major African cities and Eastern Europe. It now operates in 30 countries.  Bolt is a late entrant to the food delivery market, where a number of start-ups and other ride-sharing firms have operated for years. It plans to grab market share with lower prices for  consumers and a better cut for delivery personnel, while building on its wide user base.             “This is a very competitive market,” Jevgeni Kabanov, chief product officer at Bolt, told Reuters in an interview. “However, we have more than 25 million people around the world using Bolt and food delivery has been a popular request for quite some time.” Bolt rebranded earlier in 2019 to ensure the ride-hailing service is not confused with taxis and to represent its widening offering - it has launched scooter rentals in selected cities.  “I would say food delivery is the third big product launch for us. It fits very neatly into our strategy,” Kabanov said.  In the first half of 2019, Uber said revenue from its Uber Eats almost doubled from a year earlier to $1.1 billion. But the sector has proved challenging for a number of start-ups as investment has declined from a peak in 2015. Venture capitalists have in general pulled back from the sector amid concern over excessive competition and high valuations for companies that generally are not profitable. In Tallinn, Bolt Food’s main rival will be Helsinki-based food delivery service Wolt, which has raised $160 million since the beginning of 2018. Bolt, founded in 2013, has raised more than $200 million from investors, including Daimler and China’s Didi Chuxing Technology Co, among others.

3438,"ASPEN, Colo./WASHINGTON   - The U.S. Justice Department is working with a group of more than a dozen state attorneys general as it moves forward with a broad investigation into major technology companies, the department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, said on Tuesday. Delrahim said at a tech conference in Colorado the government is looking at previously approved acquisitions as part of a broad antitrust review announced in July of major tech firms with significant market power. “Those are some of the questions that are being raised ... whether those were nascent competitors that may or may not have been wise to approve,” Delrahim said. “Whether the intention of the incumbent was to purchase some of those competitors, I don’t know. I’m not privy to the facts of each of those investigations.” On July 23, the Justice Department said it was opening a broad investigation into whether major digital technology firms engaged in anticompetitive practices, including concerns raised about “search, social media, and some retail services online.” That was an apparent reference to Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O), and potentially Apple Inc (AAPL.O). More than a dozen states are expected to announce in the coming weeks they are launching a formal probe, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters. “I think it’s safe to say more than a dozen or so state attorneys general that have expressed an interest in the subject matter,” Delrahim said. U.S. Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat who chairs a House panel that oversees antitrust issues, said on Tuesday, “Big tech platforms aren’t going to regulate themselves. I’m pleased that several state attorneys general are now conducting their own investigation into the dominance of these firms.” In July, eight state attorneys general met with U.S. Attorney General William Barr to discuss the effect of big tech companies on competition, and various antitrust actions. The New York Attorney General’s office said on Monday it is continuing to “engage in bipartisan conversations about the unchecked power of large tech companies.” North Carolina’s attorney general, Josh Stein, is also “participating in bipartisan conversations about this issue,” his office said. The department is looking not only at price effects, but also innovation and quality, and the next steps in its broad antitrust review would be seeking documents and other information and could include some compulsory requests, Delrahim said. After the July announcement the companies under investigation “immediately reached out to work with us in a cooperative manner to provide information that we need as far as the investigation,” Delrahim added. The Federal Trade Commission in June told Facebook it had opened an antitrust investigation. Last month, the FTC resolved a separate privacy probe into Facebook’s practices after the company agreed to pay a $5 billion penalty.

3456,"  - Inverted what? Searches on Google for “inverted yield curve” have spiked after the unusual bond market phenomenon presented itself last week for the first time in over 12 years and helped tank Wall Street amid chatter that an economic downturn was imminent. Following a tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump referencing the “CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE!”, the term made its way onto news websites and radio and television reports that rarely delve into financial topics. Even late-night TV star Stephen Colbert devoted a portion of his show trying to decipher what it means when the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes falls below those for 2-year notes. As it happens, that abnormal bond market dynamic often precedes U.S. recessions, and when it appeared last Wednesday for the first time since 2007, it rattled investors worried that a U.S.-China trade war might kill both a record-long economic expansion and a decade-long bull market for stocks.  U.S. web searches for “inverted yield curve” are on track in August for their highest month on record, and more than double the next highest month December 2005, according to Google’s Google Trends analysis tool. December 2005 was the last time 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes entered an inversion trend, one that would continue through 2007 and be followed by the global financial crisis and the harshest recession since the Great Depression. Bond yields are a main measure of the return the securities deliver to investors, and they are also a proxy for interest rates. When the yields on bonds of different maturities are plotted on a graph, it produces a curve that typically has an upward slope because investors expect greater compensation for the risk of owning longer-maturity debt. An inversion, when shorter-dated yields are higher than longer-dated ones, implies that investors see greater risks in the near future. Google Trends provides data on the frequency of searches during a time period relative to other time periods. It does not provide actual numbers of web searches. After Google searches for “inverted yield curve” spiked in 2005, searches for the term entered a lull for over a decade until December 2018. That is when yields on 5-year notes dropped below yields on 2-year notes, setting off talk of a potential recession and questions about whether the more closely watched 10-year yield would invert, as it eventually did last week.  The U.S. yield curve has been slowly flattening since 2013 or earlier, and while economists and central bank policy makers have hotly debated its significance, the trend has mostly gone unnoticed by the public. The spread between U.S. 2-year and 10-year note yields has slipped below zero before each of the last five U.S. recessions, although it has taken anywhere from 12 to 24 months for the recession to occur. The curve’s inversion often ended before a recession began, and the inversions did not predict the length or severity of an economic downturn. The U.S. yield curve has returned to its normal since last Wednesday’s inversion, with benchmark 10-year notes on Monday yielding 1.611%, about 0.05 percentage points more than equivalent 2-year notes. Economists and investors are watching to see if the yield curve again reverts and enters an inverted trend, which would increase concerns across Wall Street and put more pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to bolster the economy.

3547,"OTTAWA   - Canada on Friday announced a multi-billion dollar contract with General Dynamics Corp for equipment that will be manufactured in a region where the ruling Liberals need to do well in an October election. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said Ottawa would buy 360 light armored vehicles from General Dynamics Land Systems Canada in a deal worth up to C$3 billion ($2.26 billion). It is also offering the firm a repayable loan of C$650 million. The vehicles will be built in London, in the province of Ontario. The Liberals hold most of Ontario’s seats in the House of Commons and need to retain them to stand any chance of holding onto power in the Oct. 21 election. The deal is the latest in a string of high-profile government spending announcements in politically sensitive parts of Canada. The official opposition Conservatives, tied in polls with the Liberals, accuse their rivals of trying to buy votes. Sajjan spokesman Todd Lane denied any link to the election, saying money for the vehicles had been announced in 2017. “This is about taking care of our women and men in uniform,” he said by telephone. The contract will help preserve jobs at the General Dynamics plant amid continuing uncertainty over the fate of a separate $13 billion deal to sell light armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia. Critics, citing concerns over Riyadh’s human rights record, insist the contract be scrapped. Ottawa is still studying whether to tear up the deal, which it says would cost millions of dollars in penalties.

3570,"SINGAPORE   - Buyout firms KKR (KKR.N), Blackstone (BX.N) and CVC are among bidders competing for a stake in the hospital unit of Philippines’ Metro Pacific Investments Corp (MPI.PS), people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Metro Pacific Investments, which has interests in power, water and other sectors, has said it plans to sell a 40% stake in Metro Pacific Hospitals at a valuation of $2-$2.5 billion, marking the country’s biggest healthcare deal. The bidders are, however, valuing the hospital unit at about $1.5-$2 billion, pegging the valuation at 15 to 20 times next year’s estimated core profit of the unit, the people said. The stake in the unit, the operator of 14 hospitals, many of which are among the country’s largest and most modern, has also attracted interest from other financial and strategic investors, the people said, declining to be named as the talks are private. The interest in the subsidiary underscores a strong appetite for healthcare deals in emerging markets, which are benefiting from rising spending by a rapidly growing consumer class. “There’s no asset of this sort in the Philippines. So, if you are looking to get exposure to local healthcare, this is a good play,” one private-equity executive said. Metro Pacific Investments, which owns an 85.6% stake in the hospital unit and has said it plans to use the funds from the sale to expand this business, declined to comment. More than half a dozen investors have submitted first-round indicative bids and could team up with other parties for their final offers, the sources said. Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings is among those interested in the hospital unit, one person said. KKR, CVC, Blackstone and Temasek declined to comment. One of Temasek’s portfolio firms is Sheares Healthcare Group, which invests and provides healthcare services in Asia, focusing on China, India, the Philippines, Indonesia and others. Metro Pacific Investments is a unit of First Pacific Co Ltd (0142.HK), that is owned by Indonesian tycoon Anthoni Salim. Sources said while majority control was not being offered in Metro Pacific Hospitals, some bidders were keen to take a bigger stake by setting up different shareholding structures at a later stage. The Philippines’ 40% cap on foreign ownership will apply as the unit owns real estate. Besides running hospitals, Metro Pacific Investments’ hospital subsidiary operates a network of primary care clinics and cancer centers. Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, which bought a 14.4% stake in the hospital unit in 2014, and has an option to boost its holding via an exchangeable bond, is open to paring its stake, the people said. GIC declined to comment. The Philippine sale process comes months after the Asian hospital business of Columbia Pacific Management, estimated to be valued at $2 billion, was launched, other sources said. The sale of Columbia Pacific’s Asia hospital business attracted keen interest from many investors, but steep valuations for the portfolio of mid-sized medical facilities on offer, mainly in India and Malaysia, affected the process. A buyout firm and a strategic buyer are expected to jointly acquire part of the Columbia Asia business at a lower-than-expected valuation, the sources added.

3702,"NEW YORK A protracted trade war between China and the United States, the world’s largest economies, and a deteriorating global growth outlook has left investors apprehensive about the end to the longest expansion in American history. The recent rise in U.S.-China trade war tensions has brought forward the next U.S. recession, according to a majority of economists polled by Reuters who now expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates again in September and once more next year. Trade tensions have pulled corporate confidence and global growth to multi-year lows and U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of more tariffs have raised downside risks significantly, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a recent note. Morgan Stanley forecast that if the U.S. lifts tariffs on all imports from China to 25 percent for 4-6 months and China takes countermeasures, the U.S. would be in recession in three quarters. Goldman Sachs Group said on Sunday that fears of the U.S.-China trade war leading to a recession are increasing and that Goldman no longer expects a trade deal between the world’s two largest economies before the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Global markets remain on edge with trade-related headlines spurring big moves in either direction. On Tuesday, U.S. stocks jumped sharply higher and safe-havens like the Japanese yen and Gold retreated after the U.S. Trade Representative said additional tariffs on some Chinese goods, including cell phones and laptops, will be delayed to Dec. 15. Besides watching developments on the trade front economists and investors are watching for signs they hope can alert them to a coming recession. The U.S. yield curve plots Treasury securities with maturities ranging from 4 weeks to 30 years. When the spread between the yield on the 3-month Treasury bill and that of the 10-year Treasury note slips below zero, as it did earlier this year, it points to investors accepting a lower yield for locking money up for a longer period of time. As recession signals go, this so-called inversion in the yield curve has a solid track record as a predictor of recessions. But it can take as long as two years for a recession to follow a yield curve inversion. The closely-followed yield spread between U.S. 2-year and 10-year notes has also narrowed - marking the smallest difference since at 2007 - according to Refinitiv data.  The unemployment rate and initial jobless claims ticked higher just ahead or in the early days of the last two recessions before rising sharply. Currently the U.S. unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. “Although job gains have slowed this year, they continue to signal an above-trend economy,” economists at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research said in a recent note. Claims will be watched over the coming weeks for signs that deteriorating trade relations between the United States and China, which have dimmed the economy’s outlook and roiled financial markets, were spilling over to the labor market.  The output gap is the difference between actual and potential economic output and is used to gauge the health of the economy. A positive output gap, like the one now, indicates that the economy is operating above its potential. Typically the economy operates furthest below its potential at the end of recessions and peaks above its potential towards the end of expansions. However, the output gap can linger in positive territory for years before a recession hits.  Consumer demand is a critical driver of the U.S. economy and historically consumer confidence wanes during downturns. Currently consumer confidence is near cyclical highs.  Falling equity markets can signal a recession is looming or has already started to take hold. Markets turned down before the 2001 recession and tumbled at the start of the 2008 recession. The recent pullback in U.S. stocks has done its share to raise concerns about whether the economy is heading into a recession. On a 12-month rolling basis, the market has turned down ahead of the last two recessions. The 12-month rolling average percent move is now below the recent highs of January 2018 but still above higher than the lows hit in December.  6. BOOM-BUST BAROMETER The Boom-Bust Barometer devised by Ed Yardeni at Yardeni Research measures spot prices of industrials inputs like copper, steel and lead scrap, and divides that by initial unemployment claims. The measure fell before or during the last two recessions and has retreated from a peak hit in April.  Housing starts and building permits have fallen ahead of some recent recessions. U.S. homebuilding fell for a second straight month in June and permits dropped to a two-year low, suggesting the housing market continued to struggle despite lower mortgage rates.  Given the manufacturing sector’s diminished role in the U.S. economy, the clout of the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) manufacturing index as a predictor of U.S. GDP growth has slipped in recent years. However, it is still worth watching, especially if it shows a tendency to drop well below the 50 level for an extended period of time. ISM said its index of national factory activity slipped to 51.2 last month, the lowest reading since August 2016, as U.S. manufacturing activity slowed to a near three-year low in July and hiring at factories shifted into lower gear, suggesting a further loss of momentum in economic growth early in the third quarter. “The slowdown in manufacturing activity likely reflects, in part, the tariffs that went into effect over the course of last year,” economists at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research said in a note on Friday.  S&P 500 earnings growth dipped ahead of the last recession. Earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies have been coming down but companies are still expected to post growth for most quarters this year.  10. HIGH-YIELD SPREADS The gap between high-yield and U.S. government bond yields rose ahead of the 2007-2009 recession and then widened dramatically. Credit spreads typically widen when perceived risk of default rises. Spreads have fallen from their January highs.  The Cass Freight Index, a barometer of the health of the shipping industry produced by data company Cass Information Systems Inc, logged a 5.3% year-over-year decline in June. That marked the index’s seventh straight month with a negative reading on a year-over-year basis. “Whether it is a result of contagion or trade disputes, there is growing evidence from freight flows that the economy is beginning to contract,” Broughton Capital analyst Donald Broughton wrote in the June Cass Freight Index report.  The so-called Misery Index adds together the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. It typically rises during recessions and sometimes prior to downturns. It has slipped lower in 2019 and does not look very miserable.

3734,"WASHINGTON   - The following is the text of the letter United States Attorney General William Barr sent to Congress on Sunday summarizing a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election: Dear Chairman Graham, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Ranking Member Collins: As a supplement to the notification provided on Friday, march 22, 2019, I am writing today to advise you of the principal conclusions reached by Special Counsel Robert Mueller III and to inform you about the status of my initial review of the report he has prepared. The Special Counsel’s Report On Friday, the Special Counsel submitted to me a “confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions” he has reached, as required by 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c). This report is entitled “Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election.” Although my review is ongoing, I believe that it is in the public interest to describe the report and to summarize the principal conclusions reached by the Special Counsel and the results of his investigation.  The report explains that the Special Counsel and his staff thoroughly investigated allegations that members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, and others associated with it, conspired with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, or sought to obstruct the related federal investigations. In the report, the Special Counsel noted that, in completing his investigation, he employed 19 lawyers who were assisted by a team of approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants, and other professional staff. The Special Counsel issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, obtained more than 230 orders for communication records, issued almost 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers, made 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses. The Special Counsel obtained a number of indictments and convictions of individuals and entities in connection with his investigation, all of which have been publicly disclosed. During the course of his investigation, the Special Counsel also referred several matters to other offices for further action. The report does not recommend any further indictments, nor did the Special Counsel obtain any sealed indictments that have yet to be made public. Below, I summarize the principal conclusions set out in the Special Counsel’s report. Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. The Special Counsel’s report is divided into two parts. The first describes the results of the Special Counsel’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The report outlines the Russian effort to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons associated with the Russian government in connection with those efforts. The report further explains that a primary consideration for the Special Counsel’s investigation was whether any Americans -including individuals associated with the Trump campaign - joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election, which would be a federal crime. The Special Counsel’s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. As the report states: “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” The Special Counsel’s investigation determined that there were two main Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election. The first involved attempts by a Russian organization, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States designed to sow social discord, eventually with the aim of interfering with the election. As noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the IRA in its efforts, although the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian nationals and entities in connection with these activities.  The second element involved the Russian government’s efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election. The Special Counsel found that Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons affiliated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks. Based on these activities, the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian military officers for conspiring to hack into computers in the United States for purposes of influencing the election. But as noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple. offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.  Obstruction of Justice.  The report’s second part addresses a number of actions by the President - most of which have been the subject of public reporting - that the Special Counsel investigated as potentially raising obstruction-of-justice concerns. After making a “thorough factual investigation” into these matters, the Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment. The Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion - one way or the other - as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as “difficult issues” of law and fact concerning whether the President’s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction .. The Special Counsel states that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”  The Special Counsel’s decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime. Over the course of the investigation, the Special Counsel’s office engaged in discussions with certain Department officials regarding many of the legal and factual matters at issue in the Special Counsel’s obstruction investigation. After reviewing the Special Counsel’s final report on these issues; consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense. Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president. In making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel recognized that “the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,” and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President’s intent with respect to obstruction. Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding. In cataloguing the President’s actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department’s principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of­justice offense.  Status of the Department’s Review  The relevant regulations contemplate that the Special Counsel’s report will be a “confidential report” to the Attorney General. See Office of Special Counsel, 64 Fed. Reg. 37,038, 37,040-41 (July 9, 1999). As I have previously stated, however, I am mindful of the public interest in this matter. For that reason, my goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counsel’s report as I can consistent with applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies.  Based on my discussions with the Special Counsel and my initial review, it is apparent that the report contains material that is or could be subject to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6( e ), which imposes restrictions on the use and disclosure of information relating to “matter[ s] occurring before [a] grand jury.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)(B). Rule 6(e) generally limits disclosure of certain grand jury information in a criminal investigation and prosecution. Id. Disclosure of 6( e) material beyond the strict limits set forth in the rule is a crime in certain circumstances. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 401(3). This restriction protects the integrity of grand jury proceedings and ensures that the unique and invaluable investigative powers of a grand jury are used strictly for their intended criminal justice function. Given these restrictions, the schedule for processing the report depends in part on how quickly the Department can identify the 6( e) material that by law cannot be made public. I have requested the assistance of the Special Counsel in identifying all 6( e) information contained in the report as quickly as possible. Separately, I also must identify any information that could impact other ongoing matters, including those that the Special Counsel has referred to other offices. As soon as that process is complete, I will be in a position to move forward expeditiously in determining what can be released in light of applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies.  As I observed in my initial notification, the Special Counsel regulations provide that “the Attorney General may determine that public release of’ notifications to your respective Committees “would be in the public interest.” 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(c). I have so determined, and I will disclose this letter to the public after delivering it to you.  Sincerely,  William P.

nadler ranking member feinstein and ranking member collins as a supplement to the notification provided on friday march   i am writing today to advise you of the principal conclusions reached by special counsel robert mueller iii and to inform you about the status of my initial review of the report he has prepared the special counsel s report on friday the special counsel submitted to me a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions he has reached as required by  c f r   c this report is entitled report on the investigation into russian interference in the  presidential election although my review is ongoing i believe that it is in the public interest to describe the report and to summarize the principal conclusions reached by the special counsel and the results of his investigation the report explains that the special counsel and his staff thoroughly investigated allegations that members of the presidential campaign of donald j trump and others associated with it conspired with the russian government in its efforts to interfere in the  u s presidential election or sought to obstruct the related federal investigations in the report the special counsel noted that in completing his investigation he employed  lawyers who were assisted by a team of approximately  fbi agents intelligence analysts forensic accountants and other professional staff the special counsel issued more than   subpoenas executed nearly  search warrants obtained more than  orders for communication records issued almost  orders authorizing use of pen registers made  requests to foreign governments for evidence and interviewed approximately  witnesses the special counsel obtained a number of indictments and convictions of individuals and entities in connection with his investigation all of which have been publicly disclosed during the course of his investigation the special counsel also referred several matters to other offices for further action the report does not recommend any further indictments nor did the special counsel obtain any sealed indictments that have yet to be made public below i summarize the principal conclusions set out in the special counsel s report russian interference in the  u s presidential election the special counsel s report is divided into two parts the first describes the results of the special counsel s investigation into russia s interference in the  u s presidential election the report outlines the russian effort to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons associated with the russian government in connection with those efforts the report further explains that a primary consideration for the special counsel s investigation was whether any americans including individuals associated with the trump campaign joined the russian conspiracies to influence the election which would be a federal crime the special counsel s investigation did not find that the trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with russia in its efforts to influence the  u s presidential election as the report states t he investigation did not establish that members of the trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the russian government in its election interference activities the special counsel s investigation determined that there were two main russian efforts to influence the  election the first involved attempts by a russian organization the internet research agency ira to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the united states designed to sow social discord eventually with the aim of interfering with the election as noted above the special counsel did not find that any u s person or trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the ira in its efforts although the special counsel brought criminal charges against a number of russian nationals and entities in connection with these activities the second element involved the russian government s efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election the special counsel found that russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons affiliated with the clinton campaign and democratic party organizations and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries including wikileaks based on these activities the special counsel brought criminal charges against a number of russian military officers for conspiring to hack into computers in the united states for purposes of influencing the election but as noted above the special counsel did not find that the trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with the russian government in these efforts despite multiple offers from russian affiliated individuals to assist the trump campaign obstruction of justice the report s second part addresses a number of actions by the president most of which have been the subject of public reporting that the special counsel investigated as potentially raising obstruction of justice concerns after making a thorough factual investigation into these matters the special counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment the special counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion one way or the other as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction instead for each of the relevant actions investigated the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the special counsel views as difficult issues of law and fact concerning whether the president s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction the special counsel states that while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime it also does not exonerate him the special counsel s decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the attorney general to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime over the course of the investigation the special counsel s office engaged in discussions with certain department officials regarding many of the legal and factual matters at issue in the special counsel s obstruction investigation after reviewing the special counsel s final report on these issues consulting with department officials including the office of legal counsel and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions deputy attorney general rod rosenstein and i have concluded that the evidence developed during the special counsel s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense our determination was made without regard to and is not based on the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president in making this determination we noted that the special counsel recognized that the evidence does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to russian election interference and that while not determinative the absence of such evidence bears upon the president s intent with respect to obstruction generally speaking to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person acting with corrupt intent engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding in cataloguing the president s actions many of which took place in public view the report identifies no actions that in our judgment constitute obstructive conduct had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding and were done with corrupt intent each of which under the department s principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction of justice offense status of the department s review the relevant regulations contemplate that the special counsel s report will be a confidential report to the attorney general see office of special counsel  fed reg      july   as i have previously stated however i am mindful of the public interest in this matter for that reason my goal and intent is to release as much of the special counsel s report as i can consistent with applicable law regulations and departmental policies based on my discussions with the special counsel and my initial review it is apparent that the report contains material that is or could be subject to federal rule of criminal procedure  e which imposes restrictions on the use and disclosure of information relating to matter s occurring before a grand jury fed r crim p  e  b rule  e generally limits disclosure of certain grand jury information in a criminal investigation and prosecution id disclosure of  e material beyond the strict limits set forth in the rule is a crime in certain circumstances see e g  u s c   this restriction protects the integrity of grand jury proceedings and ensures that the unique and invaluable investigative powers of a grand jury are used strictly for their intended criminal justice function given these restrictions the schedule for processing the report depends in part on how quickly the department can identify the  e material that by law cannot be made public i have requested the assistance of the special counsel in identifying all  e information contained in the report as quickly as possible separately i also must identify any information that could impact other ongoing matters including those that the special counsel has referred to other offices as soon as that process is complete i will be in a position to move forward expeditiously in determining what can be released in light of applicable law regulations and departmental policies as i observed in my initial notification the special counsel regulations provide that the attorney general may determine that public release of notifications to your respective committees would be in the public interest  c f r   c i have so determined and i will disclose this letter to the public after delivering it to you sincerely william p barr attorney general ,Brexit,0.23372484743595123
3777,"LIMA   - Peru on Friday suspended a recently issued construction permit for Southern Copper’s Tia Maria mine, a project that has triggered violent protests by nearby residents.  The permit will be suspended until government officials evaluate its legality along with objections from local authorities in the Arequipa region where Tia Maria, a $1.4 billion project, would be built, Energy and Mines Minister Francisco Ismodes told local broadcaster RPP. The review will likely take two to three months, he said. Southern Copper Corp (SCCO.N), a unit of Grupo Mexico (GMEXICOB.MX), has sought to build Tia Maria for nearly a decade, but opposition from local farmers and residents who fear pollution and loss of water supply has thwarted the effort. The mine project, expected to produce 120,000 tonnes of copper per year, has been the focus of debate over whether the significant tax revenues from mines outweigh the objections of people who live near them. Southern Copper did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ismodes said the permit was suspended to comply with a unanimous decision by a government mining commission. Peru’s business community had applauded President Martin Vizcarra’s July 9 decision to grant a construction permit for Tia Maria as a sign of his commitment to promoting investment. The suspended permit deals a fresh blow to business confidence in Peru amid slowing economic growth, but it might help calm violent protests against Tia Maria that have blocked $400 million in copper shipments from the port of Matarani. Marco Arana, a leftist lawmaker and anti-mining activist, said on RPP that local protest leaders in Arequipa would likely continue to demand full annulment of the construction permit, but its suspension might help draw local authorities back to the negotiating table. Vizcarra initially defended Tia Maria’s construction license as the result of a legally sound evaluation. But earlier this month, under pressure from regional governors, he ordered a review of its legality to take into account objections raised by local residents. Southern Copper had publicly pressured Vizcarra’s government to grant a construction license to keep its environmental plan from expiring on August 1, which would have delayed the project by at least another year.

3840,"WASHINGTON   - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting the labor market remains strong even as the economy is slowing. The jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, however, does not fully account for the impact of the recent escalation in the bitter trade war between the United States and China, which has led to an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and raised the risk of a recession.  Worries about the trade war’s effect on the economic expansion, the longest on record, prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates last week for the first time since 2008. Financial markets have fully priced in another rate cut next month. Expectations for a 50-basis-point cut at the Fed’s Sept. 17-18 policy meeting have also risen. “Initial claims have been sending a reasonably upbeat message about conditions in the labor market,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “Today’s report likely doesn’t contain much information about the period since the recent escalations in trade tensions.” Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 209,000 for the week ended Aug. 3, the government said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would be unchanged at 215,000 in the latest week.  “Though equity market volatility and low bond yields are driving pessimism about the economic outlook ... we would have to see initial claims sustain a rise to the 250,000 level to become concerned about recession,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.  U.S. stocks were trading higher partly due to unexpectedly better Chinese data and a steadying of the yuan, which provided some relief to investors alarmed by the rise in U.S.-China trade tensions. The dollar .DXY was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. INVENTORY ACCUMULATION SLOWING    Last week’s drop in claims pushed them to the lower end of their 193,000-244,000 range for this year. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, edged up 250 to 212,250 last week. Though hiring has slowed, the pace of job gains remains well above the roughly 100,000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 164,000 jobs in July, down from 193,000 in June. Job growth over the last three months averaged 140,000 per month, the lowest in nearly two years, compared to 223,000 in 2018. The moderation in employment growth partly reflects a shortage of workers.  “While net employment growth depends on gross hiring as well as the pace of layoffs, and the trend in payrolls gains may have moderated a bit, major weakening in employment growth is invariably associated with an uptrend in claims,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized rate in the second quarter, slowing from the first quarter’s brisk 3.1% pace. Growth is seen below a 2.0% rate in the July-September quarter. But economists expect the government will lower its second-quarter GDP growth estimate to around a 1.8% rate later this month after a separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed wholesale inventories were unchanged in June instead of rising 0.2% as reported last month.  The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product edged up 0.1% in June.  That suggested the pace of inventory accumulation was much slower than the government had assumed when it compiled its advance GDP report last month. The government is scheduled to publish its second GDP estimate for the April-June period on Aug. 29. According to JPMorgan’s Silver, the June wholesale data implied inventories increased at a $66 billion rate in the second quarter, instead of the $71.7 billion pace estimated in the advance GDP report.  That means inventories chopped 1.0 percentage point from GDP, rather than the estimated 0.86 percentage point. Some of the slowdown in inventory accumulation reflects a surge in consumer spending in the second quarter. Businesses are also carefully managing stock levels because of the darkening economic outlook.

3884,"WASHINGTON   - Former U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis rejoined the board of General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) on Wednesday, seven months after quitting his job in the Trump administration over disagreements about foreign policy, the defense contractor said. Mattis, a retired Marine general, had served on General Dynamics’ board but resigned in 2017 to take the top job at the Pentagon after being nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump.    Mattis resigned from the Defense Department in December after clashing with Trump on issues such as the president’s abrupt decision to pull troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. “Jim is a thoughtful, deliberate and principled leader with a proven track record of selfless service to our nation,” said General Dynamics Chairwoman and Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic in a statement. “We are honored to have him on our board.” The Trump administration has been a revolving door for industry executives serving in the government. Former Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, who filled the role as acting secretary after Trump pushed Mattis out early, was a Boeing Co (BA.N) executive.  Recently confirmed Defense Secretary Mark Esper is a former lobbyist for weapons company Raytheon Co (RTN.N). Mattis was often at odds with Trump on major policy points. He reassured North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in 2017 that it was “the most successful and powerful military alliance in modern history” after Trump questioned the need for the organization. His resignation was met with discomfort on Capitol Hill from Republicans and Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement at the time he was “particularly distressed” that Mattis was resigning over sharp differences with the president. Mattis will not engage in lobbying to the Pentagon for at least five years after his departure from the government, according to an ethics pledge issued in a Trump executive order.

3926,"NEW DELHI   - China has told India not to block its Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] from doing business in the country, warning there could be consequences for Indian firms operating in China, sources with knowledge of the matter said. India is due to hold trials for installing a next-generation 5G cellular network in the next few months, but has not yet taken a call on whether it would invite the Chinese telecoms equipment maker to take part, telecoms minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said.   Huawei, the world’s biggest maker of such gear, is at the center of a geopolitical tug-of-war between China and the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration put the company on a blacklist in May, citing national security concerns. It has asked its allies not to use Huawei equipment, which it says China could exploit for spying. Two sources privy to internal discussions in New Delhi said India’s ambassador in Beijing, Vikram Misri, was called to the Chinese foreign ministry on July 10 to hear China’s concerns about the U.S. campaign to keep Huawei out of 5G mobile infrastructure worldwide. During the meeting, Chinese officials said there could be “reverse sanctions” on Indian firms engaged in business in China should India block Huawei because of pressure from Washington, one of the sources said, citing a readout of the ambassador’s meeting. In response to Reuters’ questions, China’s foreign ministry said Beijing hoped India would make an independent decision on 5G bidders. “Huawei has carried out operations in India for a long time, and has made contributions to the development of Indian society and the economy that is clear to all,” spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement. “On the issue of Chinese enterprises participating in the construction of India’s 5G, we hope the Indian side makes an independent and objective decision, and provides a fair, just and non-discriminatory commercial environment for Chinese enterprises’ investment and operations, to realize mutual benefit.” The Indian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Responding to the Reuters story, U.S. Congressman Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican, slammed the Chinese Communist Party, saying in a tweet that it was “strong-arming” countries into “surveillance and espionage”. “China is now blackmailing India into using #Huawei for its 5G infrastructure – they know no bounds! The #CCP moves to strong-arming countries into exposing themselves to surveillance and espionage.” Indian companies have a far smaller presence in China than other major economies. But firms including Infosys, TCS, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Reliance Industries and Mahindra & Mahindra have a foothold there in manufacturing, healthcare, financial services and outsourcing. A potential row over Huawei could revive tensions in the broader India and China relationship just as the two sides have been making high-level efforts to ensure their long standing territorial disputes do not escalate.  In October, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will host Chinese President Xi Jinping in the sacred Hindu city of Varanasi, his parliamentary constituency in northern India, where the two are expected to address trade issues including a $53 billion trade deficit in 2018/19 that India is concerned about. The main right-wing group tied to Modi’s ruling alliance, which has a long-standing distrust of China and promotes self- reliance in the economy, has stepped up criticism of Huawei.  In a letter written to Modi last week, Ashwani Mahajan, the head of the economic wing of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, said there were concerns about the operations of Huawei in India.  “We as a country are not yet sure of relying on Huawei. Globally, the Chinese companies, including Huawei, are facing allegations that they ‘underbid’ projects, and position themselves and their establishment back home to snoop and enable them to shut remotely, if required be,” he wrote. Minister Prasad told parliament that six proposals have been received for 5G technology trials, including from Huawei. He did not name the others, but firms such as Sweden’s Ericsson Finland’s Nokia and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics are expected to participate.  A high-level group of officials, led by the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Indian government K Vijay Raghavan and including representatives from the departments of telecoms, information technology and the intelligence services, has been looking into whether to open the 5G trials to Huawei. The committee has found no evidence to suggest Huawei has used “back-door” programs or malware to collect data in its current operations in India, the first source and another official in the federal telecoms ministry said. The interior ministry, which is responsible for the security of the infrastructure, had issued no directive to curtail Huawei’s entry, the telecoms official said. “We can’t simply reject them just because they are Chinese,” said the official. One option that a tech expert at the government’s National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) has suggested is to ensure the hardware and software for the proposed fifth-generation network are not both sourced from Huawei.  The government should get wireless carriers who will be rolling out 5G services to use Indian-made software to drive equipment supplied by gearmakers such as Huawei, NSAB expert V.Kamakoti said in a recent internal presentation reviewed by Reuters.

3934,"  - A federal appeals court on Tuesday struck down Google’s class-action settlement meant to resolve claims it invaded the privacy of millions of computer users by installing “cookies” in their browsers, but paying those users nothing for their troubles. In a 3-0 decision, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said it could not tell whether the $5.5 million settlement was fair, reasonable and adequate, and said a lower court judge should revisit the case. Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, had been accused of exploiting loopholes in Apple Inc’s Safari and Microsoft Corp’s Internet Explorer browsers to help advertisers bypass cookie blockers. The settlement approved in February 2017 by U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Delaware called for Google to stop using cookies for Safari browsers, and pay the $5.5 million mainly to the plaintiffs’ lawyers and six groups, including some with prior Google ties, to research and promote browser privacy. But in Tuesday’s decision, Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro said the settlement raised a “red flag” and possible due process concerns because it broadly released money damages claims. He also called the awards to the privacy groups “particularly concerning.” The case was returned to the Delaware court. Lawyers for Google and the plaintiffs, who both supported the settlement, did not respond to requests for comment. The decision is a victory for Ted Frank, the litigation director at the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute and prominent critic of many class-action settlements. Frank said the money awarded to the privacy groups, under a legal doctrine known as “cy pres,” should have gone to class members like himself. He drew support from a bipartisan group of 13 state attorneys general led by Arizona’s Mark Brnovich. Cy pres, meaning “as near as possible,” is sometimes used in settlements covering large numbers of class members who might otherwise stand to receive only tiny amounts.

3980,"LONDON   - Goldman Sachs said it no longer expects the United States and China to agree on a deal to end their prolonged trade dispute before the November 2020 presidential election as policymakers from the world’s largest economies are “taking a harder line”. The bank now expects two back-to-back rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) “in light of growing trade policy risks, market expectations for much deeper rate cuts, and an increase in global risk related to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit”. The comment on U.S.-China trade and a revision to Fed expectations came after U.S. President Donald Trump said last week he would impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1, further aggravating trade tensions with Beijing. The move by Washington “suggests that both sides in the trade conflict are taking a harder line, reducing the odds of a resolution in the near term,” Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note. Hatzius said expects the new set of tariffs to remain in place on election day in November. Global equities have lost nearly $2.5 trillion on the tough rhetoric from both the United States and China. On Monday, China let the yuan slide in response to the latest U.S. tariffs. Hatzius sees a 75% chance of a rate cut by the Fed in September and a 50% chance in October, following the reduction last week. He had previously only expected two cuts this year. “The Fed has been increasingly responsive this year to trade war threats, bond market expectations, and global growth concerns,” Hatzius added.

4101,"MILAN   - Shares in Ferrari (RACE.MI) went into reverse on Friday as the Italian luxury carmaker failed to lift its guidance for 2019 despite strong results in the first part of the year. Releasing its second quarter results, the company confirmed that it was on track for the higher end of the guidance range for all relevant figures.  However, there was some disappointment as many investors and analysts thought an upgrade was in store after a forecast-beating first quarter. “The market was expecting them to raise their guidance for the year,” a Milan-based trader said. Trading in the company’s Milan-listed shares was halted for excessive declines after a 6.9% drop. They were down 3.55% by 1415 GMT.     For 2019, Ferrari forecasts its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to rise around 10% to between 1.2-1.25 billion euros. Sales are seen growing more than 3% to more than 3.5 billion euros. Chief Executive Louis Camilleri said there were several factors behind the decision not to lift earnings guidance.  He cited the discontinuation of certain models later this year, less favorable currency effects going forward, global trade tensions, and outperformance in China in the first half of the year as customers snapped up cars in anticipation of stricter anti-pollution rules. “It would seem to me that it was a prudent move on our path,” he told analysts on a post-earnings call. To support its growth, Ferrari will unveil two new models in September, Camilleri said, with one more expected by the end of the year. These are in addition to the two new models the Maranello-based company has already presented this year, including the F90 Stradale, its first hybrid - excluding special editions.  The company’s performance is a bright spot in the luxury car segment, where its competitors are struggling.  Last month Aston Martin (AML.L) cut its forecasts for volumes, investments and margins for 2019, while Tata Motors’ (TAMO.NS) luxury brand Jaguar Land Rover posted a loss in the April-June period with analysts doubting it can be turned around in the short term. Former Ferrari parent FCA’s luxury brand Maserati (FCHA.MI) also lost money, with a negative EBIT margin of 34.7%. The group’s CEO Mike Manley said he expected more difficult quarters this year. “(Ferrari) stock may take a breather today but the story remains exciting and while some were expecting more today on the guidance, we expect buying support on the dip,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report.     Ferrari said performance in the April-June period was led by robust deliveries of its 8 cylinder Portofino model and higher-margin 12 cylinder 812 Superfast model. Although shipments were up for 8 cylinder models, it cautioned they had slightly decreased for 12 cylinder models. Ferrari’s core earnings rose 8.7% in the second quarter to 314 million euros ($348 million) in line with analyst expectations, according to a Reuters survey. Margins on adjusted EBITDA weakened to 32% from 33.1% in the first quarter, versus a full-year target of 34%.     Chief Financial Officer Antonio Picca Piccon told analysts margins would suffer a little more in the third quarter compared to the high levels achieved in the same period last year. Camilleri, who took over from Sergio Marchionne after his death in 2018, said earlier this year that Ferrari is counting on hybrid models and the Purosangue SUV, expected in 2022, to exploit its potential in China. Ferrari shipped 2,671 cars in the second quarter, including 289 to China, up 63% versus the same period of last year, while shipments to the Americas fell 6% to 803 units.

4246,"MUNICH   - German prosecutors said on Wednesday they had filed charges against former Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler, who is being investigated over his role in Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) emissions test cheating scandal. Volkswagen admitted in September 2015 to having used illegal engine control software to cheat pollution tests, triggering a global backlash against diesel. The affair has so far cost the German carmaker 30 billion euros ($33.5 billion). The public prosecutor’s office in Munich said Stadler and three other defendants are being charged with fraud, false certification and criminal advertising practices. Stadler has denied any wrongdoing, his lawyer said. Premium brand Audi only admitted in November 2015 that its 3.0 litre V6 diesel engines were fitted with an auxiliary control device which was deemed illegal in the United States. Volkswagen and its former managers have faced numerous law suits, and in April prosecutors in the German city of Braunschweig charged former Volkswagen boss Martin Winterkorn with fraud over his role. The Munich prosecutor said that three of the defendants are accused of having developed engines for Audi, Volkswagen and Porsche cars that used emissions cheat devices.  “Defendant Stadler is accused of having been aware of the manipulations since the end of September 2015 at the latest, but he did not prevent the sale of affected Audi and VW vehicles thereafter,” the prosecutor said in a statement. Stadler was arrested in June 2018 as part of a broader probe into emissions cheating at Audi, which is part of Volkswagen Group, and spent several months in prison. Volkswagen later terminated Stadler’s contract against the backdrop of a criminal investigation into whether he was involved in emissions tests cheating.  The prosecutors said that his indictment relates to roughly 250,000 Audi branded cars, 112,000 Porsches and 72,000 Volkswagen cars that were sold in the U.S. and Europe. The defendants charged by the Munich prosecutor include former Audi and Porsche manager Wolfgang Hatz as well as two engineers, several people familiar with the proceedings said. Hatz, former research and development chief at Porsche and former head of powertrain development at Audi and parent Volkswagen, spent several months in custody in 2017 and 2018 over his alleged role in the emissions cheating scandal.  A lawyer for Hatz separately said his client denied any wrongdoing. The Munich prosecutors on Wednesday declined to identify the defendants, except for Stadler. Investigations against 23 further suspects continue, the prosecutor’s office said.  The Braunschweig prosecutors had said that Volkswagen’s emissions cheating took place between November 2006 and September 2015, and that Winterkorn failed in his duty to inform European and U.S. authorities after it became clear in May 2014 that diesel engines had been manipulated.  Winterkorn had also neglected to inform customers of, and did not prevent, the continued installation of fraudulent software, the prosecutors have said. Winterkorn’s lawyer has said he cannot comment on the charges because he had been denied access to important case files. Audi said in a statement on Wednesday that it was in the interest of the company, its shareholders and employees to clarify the issues that led to the diesel crisis. “Until this has happened, the presumption of innocence must prevail,” the spokesman said.

4442,"NEW YORK   - U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will have to walk a fine line to avoid roiling the stock market next week, even if the central bank delivers on expectations and lowers interest rates for the first time in more than a decade.  Investors are betting that the Fed most likely will cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 2.00% to 2.25% at the end of its two-day meeting on July 31. Whether that kicks off the first full-blown rate-easing cycle since September 2007, when the financial crisis was starting to build, or a more limited spurt of “insurance” cuts, is far from clear.  Regardless, the S&P 500 .SPX has a history of rising in the months following the onset of Fed cutting cycles, even the pair of mini-cycles in the mid-1990s.  But with the benchmark index already up 20% year-to-date partly due to rate-cut expectations, a quarter-point cut may not be enough to expand on or even sustain 2019’s gains. Instead, the market will look to Powell’s view on the economy and hints about his appetite for further cuts. “You’ll see a lot of volatility from the announcement through the end of the press conference because investors are going to parse every single word,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. Many are looking for Powell to signal more rate cuts. For example, if Powell says his next steps will be guided by numbers, this may suggest an open mind about future cuts, says TD Ameritrade chief market strategist JJ Kinahan. But if the Fed chief also comments on progress made in the economy, this may erode easing hopes. “We’re limited on the upside, but he could say a lot of things that are received poorly. What he says and how it’s interpreted could be what disappoints,” said Kinahan. “Every word has to be perfect. That’s a tough line to walk.” Friday’s stronger-than-expected reading of second-quarter U.S. gross domestic product will certainly add weight to the argument that a full-on easing cycle may not be warranted for now. How Powell characterizes the Fed’s actions against that backdrop is key. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey, says investors will look for  Powell to mention “cross-currents” from trade again and to say he will do what he can to keep the expansion intact.  Even so, “you may see after the meeting that the market takes a breather and consolidates as it waits for the next catalyst,” said Krosby, who sees a U.S.-China trade deal as the next big catalyst. Even if the short-term reaction is muted next week, history shows a positive longer-term trend for stocks after the commencement of a rate cutting cycle.   Going back to 1954, the S&P 500 rose an average of 14 percent in the 12 months after the Fed started a rate-cutting cycle, according to Audrey Kaplan, head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.     The S&P fell in the 12 months following the start of just three of 16 easing cycles. In two of those periods - 2001 and 2007 - the economy was already on the cusp of a recession when the cycle started, according to Kaplan. But Kaplan does not see a recession on the horizon this time. Instead, she is hoping for an economic boost from a rate cut or from signals of further cuts. “Rates are very low this cycle. It’s very different from the other cycles but the low and going lower rates could be good for the expansion of the economic cycle,” she said. Interest rate traders are betting that a rate cut of at least 25 basis points is a certainty, according to CME Group’s Fedwatch. They have priced in a 19.4% probability of a 50-basis point cut, which would drop the Fed’s target rate range to 1.75% to 2.00%. While some investors would welcome a 50-basis point cut on Wednesday, others worry that the Fed would cut by two notches only if it is seeing something more ominous in the economy. “The market doesn’t like surprises. It might initially rally, but with such a low probability, the longer-term question would be: ‘What are you seeing that we don’t see?’” said Ameritrade’s Kinahan.

4461,"SAN FRANCISCO   - Alphabet Inc shares rose about 8% after the company reported quarterly results that eased investors’ concerns about growth challenges facing its Google advertising business. Driven by ad sales, second-quarter revenue and earnings beat analysts’ expectations. In addition, the world’s largest online search and ads firm, unlike No. 2 online ad player Facebook Inc a day earlier, offered no worrisome guidance about increasing regulatory scrutiny. The results helped Alphabet dismiss as a rare blip a $1 billion revenue miss in the first quarter, which had prompted an outburst of investor questions and the biggest one-day sell-off in its shares in about seven years. In after-hours trade on Thursday, the shares rose to $1,226.60, on track for their biggest single-day increase in four years though still down about 4% from their high before the April slide.     Alphabet’s shares have lagged peers on Wall Street this year, rising about 9 percent through Thursday’s close, compared to a roughly 20% gain for the S&P 500 broadly. Questions linger about whether privacy, content moderation and antitrust rules proposed or already passed in the United States and other high-revenue countries will slash ad prices. Google also faces an industrywide slowdown in ad sales in the United States and Europe, with revenue from emerging markets not yet picking up the slack. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts on Thursday that advances in ad targeting and new services for consumers worldwide would spur growth. He said the company had survived calls for regulation before. “We understand there will be scrutiny,” and “we will engage constructively,” he said. Alphabet, which generates about 85 percent of its revenue from sales of ad space and ad technology, reported total second-quarter revenue of $38.9 billion. That was up 19% over last year and compared with 17% growth in the first quarter. Analysts on average estimated 16.8% growth and $38.2 billion in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The last time that Alphabet had two consecutive quarters of revenue growth below 20% was three years ago. Executives said the latest results backed their contention that the performance recently has been affected by currency exchange rates and one-off fluctuations rather than advertiser flight or some deeper challenge to its business. Alphabet’s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, appeared to dispel other analyst concerns, saying the company has seen “virtually no impact” to revenue from efforts to stop running ads on YouTube videos that some have characterized as extremist or hateful. Alphabet authorized up to $25 billion in new stock buybacks, aiming to make use of its $121 billion in cash.  Pichai said quarterly revenue from licensing cloud computing services and workplace software jumped to about $2 billion, from its last disclosure of $1 billion at the end of 2017. He said the cloud unit would triple its sales staff over the next few years. Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell told Reuters in an email that the buyback and cloud updates “suggests that management cares about stock performance, which will be a relief to shareholders!”  Net income for the second quarter rose to $9.95 billion, or $14.21 per share, compared with analysts’ estimates of $8.02 billion, or $11.32 per share.  Alphabet’s quarterly costs at $29.76 billion were about flat with the same period a year ago. The operating margin was 24%, up from 18% in the first quarter. Alphabet in its earnings release on Thursday did not mention any government investigations.  Facebook Inc, along with the release of its earnings on Wednesday, said the FTC had informed it last month that it was under antitrust investigation. The social media giant also acknowledged a broad U.S. Department of Justice antitrust review of large internet companies.  Reuters reported last month that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was gearing up to investigate Google over complaints of anti-competitive behavior. Accusations lodged against Google by rivals and other critics span its advertising, app store, search and other businesses.  On Thursday, the Texas attorney general’s office announced that a bipartisan group of state attorneys general is weighing a range of antitrust actions against big tech companies.

4589,"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday it was opening a broad investigation of major digital technology firms into whether they engage in anticompetitive practices, the strongest sign the Trump administration is stepping up its scrutiny of Big Tech. The review will look into “whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers,” the Justice Department said in a statement. The Justice Department did not identify specific companies but said the review would consider concerns raised about “search, social media, and some retail services online” — an apparent reference to Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc, and potentially Apple Inc. A Justice Department spokesman declined to provide a list of companies that would be scrutinized. Google and Apple declined to comment, referring to prior statements by executives, while Facebook and Amazon did not immediately comment. Facebook fell 1.7% in after-hours trading, while Alphabet fell 1%, Amazon was down 1.2% and Apple was 0.4% lower. The announcement comes a day before the Federal Trade Commission is set to announce a $5 billion penalty to Facebook for failing to properly protect user privacy.  Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said the Justice Department “must now be bold and fearless in stopping Big Tech’s misuse of its monopolistic power. Too long absent and apathetic, enforcers now must prevent privacy abuse, anticompetitive tactics, innovation roadblocks, and other hallmarks of excessive market power.” In June, Reuters reported the Trump administration was gearing up to investigate whether Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet’s Google misuse their massive market power, setting up what could be an unprecedented, wide-ranging probe of some of the world’s largest companies. A person briefed on the matter said the Justice review may also include some state attorneys general. The Justice Department said the review “is to assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want.” Reuters reported on May 31 that the Justice Department was preparing an investigation of Google to determine whether the tech giant broke antitrust law. Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill alike are expressing growing concerns about the size of the largest tech firms and their market power. Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for breaking up companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook and unwinding prior acquisitions. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel pressed executives from the four firms about their competitive practices and noted that Google, Facebook, Amazon had a rising share of key markets. Congress held a series of hearings last year looking at the dominance of major tech companies and their role in displacing or swallowing up existing businesses. It is rare for the government to seek to undo a consummated deal. The most famous case in recent memory is the government’s effort to break up Microsoft Corp. The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact. “There is growing consensus among venture capitalists and startups that there is a kill zone around Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple that prevents new startups from entering the market with innovative products and services to challenge these incumbents,” said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat who heads the subcommittee. Apple CEO Tim Cook told CBS News last month that scrutiny was fair but “if you look at any kind of measure about is Apple a monopoly or not, I don’t think anybody reasonable is going to come to the conclusion that Apple’s a monopoly. Our share is much more modest. We don’t have a dominant position in any market.” Google’s Adam Cohen told the House Judiciary subcommittee last week that the company had “created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals.”      Technology companies face a backlash in the United States and across the world, fueled by concerns among competitors, lawmakers and consumer groups that they have too much power and are harming users and business rivals.  U.S. President Donald Trump has called for closer scrutiny of social media companies and Google, accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online, without presenting any evidence.  Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, praised the investigation and said a Senate tech task force she chairs would be looking at how to “foster free markets and competition.” ",Big Tech faces broad

4606,"WASHINGTON   - Credit-reporting company Equifax Inc (EFX.N) will pay up to $700 million to settle claims it broke the law during a massive 2017 data breach and to repay harmed consumers, in a landmark settlement that was nonetheless criticized by consumer advocates and some lawmakers who called for stricter regulation.  While it was the largest-ever settlement for a data breach, they said the amount was still too small for the millions of Americans affected, and worried it could prove difficult for consumers to be repaid. The agreement also spurred multiple lawmakers to renew calls for legislation giving consumers more control over their personal information. “This settlement is just a drop in the bucket of what Equifax’s disregard for privacy could cost American families,” Democratic U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown said in a statement. The settlement concludes multiple probes into Equifax by the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and nearly all state attorneys general. It also resolves pending class-action lawsuits against the company. Shares in Equifax, which is one of three major credit reporting companies, closed up 0.4 percent at $137.84 a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.  Roughly 147 million people had information, including Social Security numbers and driver’s license data, compromised by the breach. The hackers have never been identified. While Equifax said on Monday it saw no evidence the stolen information had been used in identity thefts, regulators said the company failed to protect the data and misled consumers as to how secure it was. They ordered Equifax to set aside funds to repay consumers who spent time or money protecting themselves after the breach. The company will establish a $300 million restitution fund which could climb to $425 million depending on how many people file claims. Only consumers who can show they suffered direct costs following the breach, either from identity theft or by purchasing credit-monitoring services, will be eligible for restitution, capped at $20,000 per person.  Equifax Chief Executive Mark Begor told reporters Monday he expected that the initial amount, which will also cover the costs of a decade of free credit monitoring for affected consumers, would be sufficient. In an interview on Monday afternoon with CNBC, Begor said the fund could be operational by year’s end.  In addition, the company will pay a $175 million fine to the states and $100 million to the CFPB.  Consumer advocates said the settlement was modest given the huge number of people affected. “It’s a parking ticket, not a penalty,” Ed Mierzwinski of the Washington-based U.S. Public Interest Research Group said in an email. He added that consumers should not have to jump through hoops to receive compensation. Others questioned whether the fund would be sufficient given the long-term risks of having a Social Security number exposed.  “The settlement provides some compensation right now, but the risk of identity theft is forever,” said Chi Chi Wu, attorney for the National Consumer Law Center. Speaking to reporters, Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joe Simons said the agency also wanted to impose a monetary penalty, but the law does not allow it to fine companies for their first offense, an issue he has called on Congress to fix. A spokeswoman for the Massachusetts attorney general, who along with Indiana, is not participating in the settlement, said its litigation against the company was ongoing. “Equifax must pay a penalty commensurate with the worst data breach in American history,” she added. Equifax disclosed in 2017 that a data breach had compromised the personal information, including Social Security numbers, of 147 million people. The scandal sent the company into turmoil, leading to the exit of its then-CEO, Richard Smith, and multiple congressional hearings as the company’s slowness to disclose the breach and security practices were challenged by lawmakers.  Policymakers and consumer groups have questioned how private companies could amass so much personal data, sparking efforts to bolster consumers’ ability to control their information. Both the Senate Banking and House of Representatives Financial Services Committees are considering legislation that would require companies to better protect consumer data.  “We need structural reforms and increased oversight of credit reporting agencies in order to make sure that this never happens again,” Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement. Begor told reporters on Monday the company was overhauling its processes to put consumers first, and was committing $1.25 billion to bolster its data security. Equifax has also agreed as part of the settlement to several new measures, including reviews of its security policies by a government-appointed third party. Equifax’s board also must certify annually that the company has complied with the settlement terms, and could be fined if not.

4743,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO   - President Donald Trump wants a cheaper dollar, saying earlier this month the United States should match what he says are efforts by other countries to weaken their own currencies - giving them an unfair trade advantage. The comments have prompted speculation the president could order sales of the greenback, which is near a multi-decade high and, according to the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday, at least 6% stronger than warranted by economic fundamentals. “Conditions seem increasingly favorable for the U.S. administration to intervene against perceived (dollar) overvaluation,” Citi economists said in a note Wednesday. Trump has railed repeatedly against the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, complaining that the higher rates are holding back U.S. economic growth. But while signs increasingly point to the Fed’s cutting rates when it meets at the end of this month, the lower rates are unlikely to weaken the dollar to a level that Trump wants. A weaker dollar could help U.S. businesses compete globally by making exports less expensive, boosting the economy and potentially helping Trump’s bid for re-election in 2020. But a currency intervention could spark pushback from other countries, jeopardize the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency and touch off market turmoil. It is also not clear the Trump administration can significantly weaken the dollar without help from the U.S. central bank, which operates independently, or new powers from Congress. Trump’s talking down the dollar - an unusual step for a U.S. president - has been effective, though less so more recently. To weaken it further, the U.S. Treasury could sell the greenback to buy foreign currency, using dollars that it holds on reserve. It has not done that since spending $1.3 billion in September 2000 as part of an international effort to combat a collapse in Europe’s currency, the euro. Most of America’s $126 billion in reserves are parked in its Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). But if Washington’s unilateral actions spark a currency war, that might not be enough firepower to win. “There are plenty of hedge funds that have more clout than that,” said Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics. By comparison, China has $3.1 trillion in reserves. Roughly $5 trillion are traded in the world’s currency markets each day. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview that the ESF was meant for minimizing distress in currency markets, a possible indication that Washington is not viewing it as a way to engineer a sustained weakening in the dollar. “We always look at what the fund can be used for in different alternatives, but as of now there is no change in policy,” he said. A Treasury spokeswoman added that the department’s overall policy on the U.S. dollar has not changed. The Treasury uses the Federal Reserve as its agent in financial markets, and traditionally the two agencies coordinate interventions. To intervene more heavily, the Treasury could require resources from the Federal Reserve, which might potentially create limitless dollars to sell. The administration could also seek access to more funds from Congress, said Joseph Gagnon, fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former economist at both the Fed and the Treasury. That might entail lifting a legal limit on the Treasury's borrowing authority, allowing the administration to raise more cash to buy foreign currencies. ""If you get rid of the debt ceiling, it's clear the U.S. would win in a currency war,"" said Gagnon. tmsnrt.rs/2kaagK4 Getting the Fed on board would pose its own challenges. The Fed sets interest rates to meet mandates assigned by Congress: stable prices, full employment and moderate long-term interest rates. A weaker dollar could make imports into the United States more expensive and help the Fed by pushing inflation toward the central bank’s 2% target. But intervening in foreign exchange markets to drive it lower would go against a 2013 agreement among finance ministers and central bankers of the world’s biggest economies to avoid using exchange rate targets to meet their economic objectives. “It is not clear the Fed would be willing to act unilaterally in a way that would antagonize the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank,” said Brad Setser, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Speaking on June 19, Fed Chair Jerome Powell declined to say whether the central bank would support a currency intervention, saying that exchange rate policy is the Treasury’s responsibility. Even with limitless dollars, it is not clear Washington could control the value of the dollar, which reflects the strength of the U.S. economy and the attractiveness of its assets compared with those of other countries. A key source of the dollar’s strength is the relative weakness of the European economy which has led the European Central Bank to keep interest rates low while the Fed has raised borrowing costs since 2015. The dollar has strengthened recently due to reduced investor appetite for risky assets amid rising trade tensions and a slowing global economy, according to the IMF assessment. The IMF said the euro’s valuation was appropriate for the euro zone as a whole but was too low for Germany’s fundamentals. ""Interventionist measures to drive down the dollar's value are likely to be overwhelmed by the configuration of macroeconomic fundamentals,"" said Eswar Prasad, a trade policy expert at Cornell University. tmsnrt.rs/2Sj673q  The dollar may be poised to weaken even without any actual U.S. intervention. Just the possibility is putting downward pressure on the greenback, said Stan Shipley, strategist at ISI Evercore. Meanwhile, U.S. economic growth is widely expected to slow, closing the gap with growth in Europe. Widening U.S. budget deficits, which delivered a boost to growth and the dollar last year, could drag down the U.S. currency longer-term, economists say. And the Fed’s expected rate cut later this month, along with further anticipated reductions over the next year or so, should also have an effect. ""Monetary policy itself looks like it's almost certainly going to pull the dollar downward,"" said Erik Norland, an economist at CME Group, whose interest-rate futures market is widely used as a gauge of market expectations for Fed policy. tmsnrt.rs/2k3DWsA ",Trump wants weaker dollar but it could be a hard sell,"July 18, 2019 /  11:21 AM ",washington san francisco president donald trump

4913,"  - U.S. antiviral drugmaker Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) will invest $5.1 billion in a major expansion of its partnership with Belgo-Dutch biotech Galapagos NV (GLPG.AS), news that lifted Galapagos’s shares more than 18% to an all-time high on Monday. The move will bring Gilead’s new chief executive Daniel O’Day growth opportunities in Galapagos’s specialist areas including fibrosis and arthritis, and give Galapagos deep funds to develop and commercialize its drugs. The two companies are going after inflammatory conditions, one of the most lucrative areas in the pharmaceuticals industry. AbbVie’s (ABBV.N) Humira, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and spondylitis, racked up nearly $20 billion in sales in 2018, while Amgen (AMGN.O) and Pfizer’s (PFE.N) Enbrel still brings in $7 billion annually after 20 years on the market.     As part of the deal, Gilead will spend $1.1 billion to lift its Galapagos stake to 22% from 12.3%. The rest of the investment will be used to develop and commercialize its treatments for a 10-year period, the companies said. “We chose to partner with Galapagos because of its pioneering target and drug discovery platform, proven scientific capabilities and outstanding team,” O’Day said in a statement. Galapagos, which has more than 500 scientists, is part of a thriving biotech scene centered around Belgium, fueled by tax breaks and other incentives, with companies spun out of universities now listed on the local stock exchange. The deal follows a spate of biotech mergers last year including the acquisition of fellow Belgian biotech Ablynx by French drugmaker Sanofi (SASY.PA) for 3.9 billion euros ($4.4 billion) after a bidding war with Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO). Galapagos’s most advanced drug in development is filgotinib, an experimental compound being advanced for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease that Gilead intends to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year. The two companies first partnered four years ago to develop a drug targeting inflammatory diseases, with Gilead paying more than $2 billion for the development of filgotinib, as well as an equity stake in the European firm. Gilead is paying a 10% premium to Friday’s closing price for the increased stake in Galapagos, but has a 10-year standstill agreement preventing it from raising its stake above 29.9%. “We see a logical rationale for the deal and believe that over time the closer relationship should help both companies,” RBC analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a note, reiterating his “buy” recommendation on Gilead stock. Shares in Galapagos rose 18.8% to 152.20 euros. Galapagos said it would also seek shareholder approval to allow Gilead to further increase its ownership to up to 29.9%. The companies will share future development costs for filgotinib equally, replacing the 80-20 cost split provided by the original agreement, they said, with Galapagos gaining a broader role in the treatment’s commercialization in Europe. Gilead will get access to Galapagos’s drug pipeline outside of Europe. Gilead will nominate two people to Galapagos’ board.

4982,"PARIS   - Renault (RENA.PA) has handed French prosecutors the conclusions of an audit into its joint finances with alliance partner Nissan (7201.T), the carmaker said on Friday. The audit, carried out by accountancy firm Mazars in the wake of the Carlos Ghosn scandal, identified 11 million euros ($12.4 million) in questionable spending by the Dutch-registered alliance subsidiary Renault-Nissan BV, Renault said in April. Former chairman Ghosn, ousted by both carmakers following his November arrest in Tokyo, is awaiting trial on financial misconduct charges he denies. Renault submitted the audit findings in response to a requisition by prosecutors, the company said in a statement. “Renault is fully cooperating with the authorities and will not comment on the report’s content to avoid the risk of jeopardizing the proper conduct of the investigation,” it added.

5024,"  - A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected an effort by three major U.S. cities to require the Pentagon to be more vigilant about reporting service members who were disqualified from owning weapons to a national background check system. By a 3-0 vote, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it lacked jurisdiction to compel the Department of Defense to fix what New York City, Philadelphia and San Francisco called a “broken” system, or to supervise improvements to the Pentagon’s “partial and inconsistent reporting.” The cities sued seven weeks after former Air Force member Devin Kelley killed 26 people on Nov. 5, 2017 at a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church before killing himself. Kelley, 26, was convicted in a 2012 court martial of assaulting his wife and stepson and should not have been allowed to possess weapons. But his conviction had not been entered into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The cities said the Pentagon had failed to report some 15,000 current or former personnel who could not own guns because of court martial convictions or dishonorable discharges, and that this undermined their ability to fight violent crime. Writing for the Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court, Circuit Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson praised efforts by cities and towns nationwide to protect the public from violence that is too often committed by people who should not have firearms. “The APA, however, does not permit their efforts to include judicial supervision of the myriad programmatic workings of the federal government,” Wilkinson wrote, referring to the federal Administrative Procedure Act.  He said courts couldn’t step in despite what the cities viewed as the Pentagon’s widespread and systemic failure to provide disqualifying conviction records for former personnel. “The department has admitted as much and is engaged in extensive efforts to increase its compliance,” Wilkinson wrote. A spokesman for New York’s law department said it was disappointed with the decision, but also pleased with the court’s admonishment for the Pentagon’s lapses. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said his office will evaluate its legal options.  Philadelphia’s law department declined to comment. The U.S. Department of Justice, which represented the Pentagon, also did not respond to requests for comment. Wednesday’s decision upheld an April 2018 ruling by U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton in Alexandria, Virginia.

5262,"PARIS   - Renault-Nissan has not decided whether to publish figures on cost savings and other synergies achieved by the alliance over the last year, as has been its custom, two sources close to Renault said, amid growing tension in the partnership. Over the past decade, the group has released figures each summer detailing how much money has been saved through cost-cutting, production sharing and other efficiencies, establishing it as a barometer of the health of the 20-year-old alliance.   But since Carlos Ghosn, the former group chairman, was arrested in Japan and charged with corruption, relations between Renault and Nissan have frayed, raising doubts about the future of the one of the more successful auto alliances. “People have changed, governance has changed, why go on doing exactly the same thing,” one of the sources told Reuters, referring to the annual synergy figures.  “We haven’t taken a definitive decision (on whether to publish it).” The last cost-saving announcement, approved by the management of each company, was made in June 2018 and detailed synergies of 5.7 billion euros ($6.4 billion) achieved in 2017.  That was up from 5 billion euros in 2016, 4.3 billion euros in 2015, 3.8 billion euros in 2014 and 2.9 billion euros in 2013. The figures were first published in 2010.  The target for 2018, according to the last forecast published before the Ghosn affair, was for cost-savings and revenue gains totaling 5.5 billion euros, slightly down on 2017.  The long-term objective was to hit 10 billion euros by 2022-2023 — out of total annual revenue, with Mitsubishi having joined the alliance in 2017, of around 170 billion euros.

5263,"SAN SALVADOR DE JUJUY, Argentina   - In Argentina’s remote northern province of Jujuy, Chinese telecoms giant ZTE is installing a little slice of the Asian nation’s vast surveillance state - security cameras that the local government says will help to curb street crime. Even this relatively small, little-reported deal is raising concerns in Washington, which is increasingly warning allies not to buy Chinese technology that it says could be used by Beijing to spy on its customers. ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) sealed a nearly $30 million surveillance contract with Jujuy in March to provide cameras, monitoring centers, emergency services, and telecommunications infrastructure. ZTE first made its sales pitch three years ago.  The deal is an example of the tech inroads China is making in Latin America even as the United States warns about the dangers of using Chinese technology, especially related to surveillance. A Chinese official in Buenos Aires told Reuters the Jujuy project could help China expand its tech footprint in the country, by encouraging other cities to adopt similar technology. Washington has “concerns” about ZTE’s project in Jujuy, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department’s Western Hemisphere Affairs Bureau said in a statement. “China gathers and exploits data on an unrivaled scale, and uses the information to promote corruption, support arbitrary surveillance, and silence dissent,” the spokeswoman said. The U.S. worries about the project, which have not been previously reported, show how the United States is scrutinizing both big deals and small in its efforts to slow the spread of Chinese security technology around the globe. The United States has offered little public evidence to support its warnings to allies, and Argentine and Chinese officials played down concerns about the Jujuy project in interviews and statements to Reuters. ZTE, which has a small presence in Argentina, declined to share company data on its surveillance technology projects in Latin America or to comment for this story.    At an event in the provincial capital San Salvador de Jujuy in May, ZTE’s general manager in Argentina, Dennis Wang, alongside Governor Gerardo Morales, his security minister and police officials, made a presentation and described how the technology had helped cut crime rates in China.  Jujuy already has close ties to China. A Chinese company is heavily invested in lithium mining in the province and China has provided the financing and technology for a huge solar farm, South America’s largest. Now Jujuy can be “safe like China,” the local government said in an announcement about the event. China’s lower crime rate is due in part to its sprawling - and contentious - surveillance apparatus of cameras, facial recognition software, citizen databases and courts controlled by the ruling Communist Party that have high conviction rates. To be sure, authorities in many democratic nations including the United States and Britain also make wide use of surveillance technology. However, human rights watchdogs say China abuses these powers to suppress dissent and protest by its own citizens.    China has built an extensive video surveillance system and installed smartphone monitoring technology in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where more than a million Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained in so-called vocational training centers. ZTE and its subsidiaries have been heavily involved in building China’s internal surveillance project, according to procurement documents, including the surveillance infrastructure in Xinjiang. The Chinese official in Buenos Aires dismissed U.S. worries as “anxiety” over the success of Chinese firms, especially in the race towards 5G telecommunications technology that firms like ZTE and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] are spearheading. The official, who asked not to be named, said Latin American countries had a growing need to improve security, creating an opportunity for China to sell surveillance technology at a competitive price. China’s foreign ministry said the U.S accusation that China exploited data gathered by its companies was “absurd.” The country was a “firm safeguarder of internet security”, it said. There have been no expressions of concern about the deal in Argentina, where China - a major trading partner and financier - is viewed as an important ally and not a threat. Argentina’s foreign ministry declined to comment on the U.S concerns.   Jujuy officials have reason to be open to affordable Chinese tech. The province is one of the poorest in Argentina and has crime rates slightly above the national average. Security Minister Ekel Meyer said in an interview in San Salvador de Jujuy that residents accepted the watchful eye of the security cameras in exchange for safer streets. He wants to take it even further by expanding the system to include facial recognition technology, a tool China has been rolling out as part of its domestic surveillance web. Meyer said any citizen who was law abiding had nothing to fear from the surveillance system. “This protects him,” he said. ZTE had already set up a small test zone in a local public city park and shipments for the first phase of the project arrive in September, the government said. A source with knowledge of the Jujuy project said government officials had not carried out any kind of assessment of the technology’s vulnerabilities. Joseph Cannataci, a UN Special Rapporteur for data privacy, told Reuters during a recent visit to Argentina that the country needed to do a better job of vetting security equipment and software that it purchased. “I don’t care who you buy it from ... You should not assume that the vendor you are buying from is to be trusted. You should carry out your privacy impact assessment,” he said, referring to a U.N.-recommended test to ensure people’s right to privacy is not violated.  U.S.-CHINA TECH WAR The United States and China are in the middle of protracted trade standoff, with tech at the core. ZTE itself was hit with a crippling supplier ban last year, and the White House has since taken aim at even larger rival, Huawei.  This has seen the United States look to persuade, often loudly, global trade partners to shun Chinese-made technology, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo firing such warnings during a Latin America tour earlier this year. “The Chinese Communist Party is using technology equipment and services exports to promote Tiananmen-style repression across Latin America,” a White House official told Reuters. China launched a deadly crackdown on protesting students in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989 in which rights groups say possibly thousands of people were killed. There have not been any similar incidents in Latin America this century.   “Telecommunications equipment purchasing decisions being made today will have a lasting impact on how the United States works with partners and who it chooses to partner with in the future,” the U.S. official said.  In South America those warnings, however, appear to be falling on deaf ears. In Venezuela, ZTE also helped the government of President Nicolas Maduro roll out a smart-card ID known as the “fatherland card.” The ID transmits data about cardholders to servers supplied by ZTE and is increasingly linked by the government to subsidized food, health and other social programs.  In Ecuador, Huawei and state-owned China National Electronics Import & Export Corporation built a surveillance system of more than 4,000 cameras for the government that was installed in 2011. In Uruguay, the government announced in February a Chinese donation of 2,100 Huawei security cameras for installation in four cities.    In Brazil, despite Trump calling for President Jair Bolsonaro to sideline Huawei, Brazilian Vice President Hamilton Mourao said in June the government would not exclude the Chinese firm from operating a 5G mobile telecoms network. Analysts said the United States had taken its eye off the ball in the resource-rich region as China had increased its global clout.  “Team China is offering good technology, at a very reasonable price with very favorable financing. It’s a pretty compelling package and the U.S. doesn’t really have alternatives to that,” said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at the Eurasia Group.

5508,"NEW YORK   - A lawyer for former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli on Friday urged a federal appeals court to overturn Shkreli’s criminal conviction for defrauding investors in hedge funds he founded. The lawyer, Mark Baker, argued that the jury that convicted Shkreli was given incorrect instructions about securities fraud. Baker faced a barrage of skeptical questions from a three-judge panel during a brief proceeding in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. Shkreli, 36, gained notoriety as the “Pharma Bro” after founding Turing Pharmaceuticals, buying the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim and raising its price by 5,000 percent, to $750 per pill in 2015. He was charged with securities fraud and conspiracy in December 2015, convicted by a federal jury in Brooklyn in August 2017 and sentenced to seven years in prison last year. He was also ordered to forfeit more than $7 million. His criminal case stemmed from two hedge funds and a drug company he had founded years before Turing. The jury found that he defrauded investors in the funds, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, by sending them fake account statements and concealing huge losses, and schemed to prop up the stock price of the drug company, Retrophin Inc. The jury acquitted him of related wire fraud conspiracy charges, for which it received slightly different instructions. Baker argued on Friday that the split verdict showed the instructions had made the difference. “The split verdict in this case speaks volumes as to the care the jury took,” he said. Circuit Judge Joseph Bianco, however, said the jury instructions appeared necessary after Shkreli’s lawyer at trial suggested that Shkreli could not be guilty because he eventually paid his investors back. Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston pressed Baker on that point: “A belief that ultimately no one will be harmed is not a defense to a securities fraud case, correct?” Baker conceded that it was not. Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith, arguing for the prosecution, said the different instructions for securities fraud and wire fraud reflected a difference in the laws on those crimes. In a brief rebuttal, Baker said that even if Shkreli’s conviction stands, the fact that he eventually paid back investors should “wipe out” his obligation to forfeit cash. The Brooklyn-born Shkreli, the son of Albanian immigrants, is scheduled to be released from prison in October 2023 if he fails to get his conviction tossed out.

5525,"PINGDINGSHAN, China   - In a village in central China’s Henan province, amid barking dogs and wandering chickens, villagers gather along a dirt road to trade images of their faces for kettles, pots and tea cups. At the front of the line, a woman stands in front of a camera zip-tied to a tripod. She holds a photograph of her head with the eyes and the nose cut out in front of her face and slowly rotates side to side.  Villagers waiting their turn take a numbered ticket. Some of them say it’s the third or fourth time they’ve come to do this sort of work. The project, run out of a sleepy courtyard village house adorned with posters of former China leader Mao Zedong, is collecting material that could train AI software to distinguish between real facial features and still images. “The largest projects have tens of thousands of people, all of whom live in this area.” said Liu Yangfeng, CEO at Qianji Data Co Ltd, which collects and labels data for several of China’s largest tech firms and is based in the nearby city of Pingdingshan. “We are creating more data sets to serve more AI algorithm companies, so they can serve the development of artificial intelligence in China,” said Liu, declining to disclose his clients. The boom in demand for data to train AI algorithms is feeding a new global industry that gathers information such as photos and videos, which are then labeled to tell the machines what they are seeing. Companies involved in data labeling or data annotation as it is also called include crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) Mechanical Turk which offer users small amounts of money in return for simple tasks, outsourcing firms such as India’s Wipro Ltd (WIPR.NS) as well as professional labellers like Qianji. Cognilytica, a U.S. research firm specializing in AI, estimates the global market for machine-learning related data annotation grew 66% to $500 million in 2018 and is set to more than double by 2023. Some industry insiders say, however, that much of the work done is not disclosed, making accurate estimates difficult.   China has emerged as a key hub for data collection and labeling thanks to insatiable demand from a burgeoning artificial intelligence sector backed by the ruling Communist Party, which sees AI as an engine of economic growth and a tool for social control. A plethora of firms have invested heavily in an area of AI known as machine learning, which is at the core of facial recognition technology and other systems based on finding patterns in data. These include tech giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), Tencent Holding Ltd (0700.HK), Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) as well as younger companies such as AI specialist SenseTime Group Ltd and speech recognition firm Iflytek Co Ltd (002230.SZ). The result has been a proliferation of AI products and services in China, from facial recognition-based payment systems to automated surveillance and even AI-animated state media news anchors. Chinese consumers mostly see these technologies as novel and futuristic, despite concerns raised by some over more invasive applications. Weak data privacy laws and cheap labor have also been a competitive advantage for China as it races to become a global leader in AI. The Henan villagers were happy to trade several sessions in front of a camera for a tea cup, or several hours for a stove-top pot. Beijing-based BasicFinder, a leading data labeling firm with locations across Hebei, Shandong and Shanxi provinces, boasts a robust mix of domestic and overseas clients. At a recent visit to its Beijing offices, some staff were labeling images of sleepy people that will be used by an autonomous driving project to identify drivers who might be falling asleep at the wheel. Others were labeling British documents from the 1800s for a Western online ancestry service, marking fields for dates, names and genders on birth and death certificates. According to BasicFinder Chief Executive Du Lin, hiring trained labellers in China is cheaper than using Western crowdsourcing marketplaces. A Princeton University project related to autonomous driving initially put a task on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk but as the task became more complicated, people began making mistakes and BasicFinder was brought in to help correct the results, said Du. In that project, one trained BasicFinder labeler was able to do the work of three crowdsourced labellers, he added. “Gradually they saw they were paying less for labeling from us, so they hired us to label all the works from the very beginning,” said Du. Princeton declined to comment. For labeling employees, the reasons for joining China’s data industry are straightforward. The work, though sometimes tedious, is an upgrade on other jobs available to young workers who want to return home to small Chinese cities and villages. Labellers at Qianji make roughly 100 yuan ($14.50) a day marking data points on photographs of people, surveillance footage and street images. The work is usually simple, according to the employees, though some overseas content poses a challenge. “One time we thought we were classifying Europe-style cooker machines that have a washer attached,” said Jia Yahui, a labeler at Qianji. “Later we were told it’s actually two separate things, a stove and a dishwasher.” The labeling work brings some of the employment benefits of the tech sector to rural areas, but those benefits may prove short-lived if AI improves enough to perform many of the tasks labellers do. “We think this industry will still exist in three to five years. It may not be a long-term career - we can only think of the five-year plan for now,” said Qianji CEO Liu.

5565,"DETROIT   - At Planet Ford, which boasts it is the No. 1 Ford volume dealer in the Houston area, customers shopping for a 2019 F-150 pickup truck can get discounts from Ford Motor Co (F.N) of more than $8,000 - and that is just the start.   The dealership’s website lists a dozen other ways for truck buyers to get a price cut: being a student, a member of the military or a first-responder organization, a season-ticket holder for the National Football League’s Houston Texans, or a member of the Farm Bureau. “Ford is a sponsor of the Houston Rodeo, and offers an additional $1,000 rebate on the F-150 to people who volunteer with the rodeo,” said Aaron Smith, general sales manager at Planet Ford. Rodeo fans would feel right at home watching the frenzied competition in the U.S. large pickup truck market.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N), General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford escalated a price war in June in one of the few vehicle market segments on the planet that offers substantial profits - and one in which the three Detroit automakers enjoy an oligopoly, shielded by heavy tariffs on foreign competition.  During the past month, dealers for FCA’s Ram truck brand, GM’s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks and Ford’s F-series truck line have been offering discounts of up to 30% or more off the list price. The GMC brand is promoting June as “Truck Month,” signaling to consumers that deep discounts are on offer until the close of the sales reporting period, July 1. U.S. automakers report June and second-quarter sales next week.  While the heavy discounts are available in much of the country, not all dealers are offering such deals. More popular limited-production models such as Ford’s F-150 Raptor are selling for full retail price. Overall, discounts on light-duty pickup trucks in June have averaged $5,250, 11% higher than the year-to-date average of $4,726, according to market research firm J.D. Power. The price-cutting is unusual because FCA’s Ram brand and GM’s Chevrolet and GMC brands launched new versions of their large pickups within the last year. Normally, automakers avoid major discounts on freshly redesigned vehicles.  But these are not normal times. FCA Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley said last year he wants to move the Ram pickup line into second place in U.S. sales, displacing Silverado and closing the gap with Ford’s F-series, the segment leader for 42 years. The new Ram has received enthusiastic reviews for its stylish interior and optional 12-inch (30.5 cm) display screen, and sales are up nearly 22% this year through May, selling 22,000 more vehicles than the Silverado.  “Clearly, FCA is trying to grab market share while GM is still ramping up,” said Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs. FCA said in a statement on Thursday the automaker will “stick with what works for us.” GM is under pressure to deliver as much as $10 billion in free cash flow in the final three quarters of 2019 to hit its full-year target, amid stagnant U.S. demand and plummeting industry sales in China.  GM will report second-quarter U.S. sales on July 2. Automotive News estimated Silverado sales fell 11.8% through May, while sales of the higher-priced GMC Sierra were up 4%. “We will defend our franchise and we will do it the right way,” said Barry Engle, head of GM’s North American operations. “We’re not going to just roll over and allow our truck business to be taken away from us.” Engle said Silverado sales numbers in part reflect an effort to build more higher-margin Sierras aimed at buyers willing to spend extra dollars on a luxury truck. Ford, which has the oldest pickup truck in the market, had flat F-series sales through the end of May.      “It’s a bit unprecedented,” said Ford’s truck marketing manager, Todd Eckert, of the heavy discounting so early in the life cycle of his rivals’ trucks.  Ford will defend its position, but not at any cost, he said: “It’s about having a balanced approach.” Because incentives erode profit margins, the automakers continue to juggle discounts against diminished margins. “This is a segment that has been profitable for all of us,” said GM’s Engle. “We’d like to keep it that way.” ",Ram tough: FCA turns up the heat on GM and Ford in U.S. truck sales war,"June 27, 2019 /  9:47 PM ",detroit at planet ford which boasts it is the no  ford volume dealer in the houston area customers shopping for a  f  pickup truck can get discounts from ford motor co f n of more than   and that is just the start the dealership s website lists a dozen other ways for truck buyers to get a price cut being a student a member of the military or a first responder organization a season ticket holder for the national football league s houston texans or a member of the farm bureau ford is a sponsor of the houston rodeo and offers an additional   rebate on the f  to people who volunteer with the rodeo said aaron smith general sales manager at planet ford rodeo fans would feel right at home watching the frenzied competition in the u s large pickup truck market fiat chrysler automobiles fca fcha mi fcau n general motors co gm n and ford escalated a price war in june in one of the few vehicle market segments on the planet that offers substantial profits and one in which the three detroit automakers enjoy an oligopoly shielded by heavy tariffs on foreign competition during the past month dealers for fca s ram truck brand gm s chevrolet silverado and gmc sierra trucks and ford s f series truck line have been offering discounts of up to  or more off the list price the gmc brand is promoting june as truck month signaling to consumers that deep discounts are on offer until the close of the sales reporting period july  u s automakers report june and second quarter sales next week while the heavy discounts are available in much of the country not all dealers are offering such deals more popular limited production models such as ford s f  raptor are selling for full retail price overall discounts on light duty pickup trucks in june have averaged    higher than the year to date average of   according to market research firm j d power the price cutting is unusual because fca s ram brand and gm s chevrolet and gmc brands launched new versions of their large pickups within the last year normally automakers avoid major discounts on freshly redesigned vehicles but these are not normal times fca chief executive officer mike manley said last year he wants to move the ram pickup line into second place in u s sales displacing silverado and closing the gap with ford s f series the segment leader for  years the new ram has received enthusiastic reviews for its stylish interior and optional  inch   cm display screen and sales are up nearly  this year through may selling   more vehicles than the silverado clearly fca is trying to grab market share while gm is still ramping up said cox automotive analyst michelle krebs fca said in a statement on thursday the automaker will stick with what works for us gm is under pressure to deliver as much as  billion in free cash flow in the final three quarters of  to hit its full year target amid stagnant u s demand and plummeting industry sales in china gm will report second quarter u s sales on july  automotive news estimated silverado sales fell   through may while sales of the higher priced gmc sierra were up  we will defend our franchise and we will do it the right way said barry engle head of gm s north american operations we re not going to just roll over and allow our truck business to be taken away from us engle said silverado sales numbers in part reflect an effort to build more higher margin sierras aimed at buyers willing to spend extra dollars on a luxury truck ford which has the oldest pickup truck in the market had flat f series sales through the end of may it s a bit unprecedented said ford s truck marketing manager todd eckert of the heavy discounting so early in the life cycle of his rivals trucks ford will defend its position but not at any cost he said it s about having a balanced approach because incentives erode profit margins the automakers continue to juggle discounts against diminished margins this is a segment that has been profitable for all of us said gm s engle we d like to keep it that way ,Brexit,0.17527709901332855
5576,"  - State Street Corp agreed to pay $94.3 million to settle federal and state regulatory charges it routinely overcharged mutual fund customers and other clients over roughly 17 years by adding hidden markups on back-office expenses. Thursday’s settlements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey resolve allegations that State Street overbilled clients by more than $170 million related to its custody of their assets. The SEC said roughly 5,000 clients incurred more than $110 million of the overcharges when State Street tacked on markups for sending messages through SWIFT, a secured international payments network used by banks and other financial companies. “Fund expenses make a big difference to mutual fund investors and advisers,” Paul Levenson, director of the SEC office in Boston, said in a statement. “They have a right to receive honest information about what they’re paying for.” State Street will pay a $40 million civil fine plus $48.8 million of disgorgement and interest in the SEC settlement, and a $5.5 million civil fine to Massachusetts. It did not admit or deny wrongdoing, and was credited by the SEC for disclosing its conduct and cooperating. State Street previously set aside money to cover both settlements. “We regret these invoicing errors and the impact on our clients,” State Street said in a statement. State Street is one of the world’s largest custodial banks, which provide services such as accounting, asset valuations, currency trading, portfolio servicing and stock lending. The Boston-based company had $32.6 trillion of assets under custody and administration as of March 31, as well as $2.81 trillion of assets under management. State Street said it began reviewing customer invoices in 2015, and has since reimbursed most customers affected by the overcharges, while also improving its billing processes. It has said it was cooperating with probes by the U.S. Department of Justice’s civil and criminal divisions into its invoicing, which Thursday’s settlements do not cover. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In July 2016, State Street agreed to pay $530 million to settle regulatory probes and private lawsuits claiming it overcharged clients on foreign currency transactions.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office submitted the filing to a U.S. District Court judge in Washington who had asked for more details on Mueller’s allegations last month that Manafort had breached a plea agreement by lying. “In his interviews with the Special Counsel’s Office and the FBI, Manafort told multiple discernible lies — these were not instances of mere memory lapses,” Mueller’s office said in the filing.  According to the filing, Manafort lied about his interactions with Russian-Ukranian political consultant Konstantin Kilimnik, Kilimnik’s efforts to tamper with witnesses, the circumstances surrounding a $125,000 payment to a firm working for Manafort, and Manafort’s contacts with officials in the Trump administration. Manafort also provided investigators with shifting accounts about information relevant to another Department of Justice investigation.

5662,"TOKYO   - Walmart said it aims to list its Japanese supermarket unit Seiyu while keeping a majority stake in the business, amid on-and-off speculation the U.S. retail giant was looking to exit Japan where it has struggled to grow. Lionel Desclee, who was hired earlier this year as CEO of Walmart Japan, said in a speech to employees on Wednesday that Walmart would remain invested in Seiyu. “We also have a longer-term aspiration to list a minority stake of our business in Japan,” he said in a speech, according to a Walmart Japan statement. “We believe a Japan listing would empower Seiyu to accelerate the journey of building a strong, innovative local value retailer both in-stores and online, while still enjoying the benefits of being powered by Walmart,” he was also quoted as saying. No time-frame for a listing was mentioned.  Walmart first entered the Japanese market in 2002 by buying a 6 percent stake in Seiyu, and gradually built up its stake before a full takeover in 2008. But Japan has proven a difficult market for Walmart and other foreign entrants such as Tesco PLC and Carrefour SA. Japanese media reported last year that Walmart considered selling Seiyu, and that a sale could amount to around 300 billion to 500 billion yen ($2.69 billion to $4.48 billion). Consumers in Japan demand fresh food and efficient customer service, and the country’s supermarket industry is highly competitive and its margins razor thin after years of deflation. Judith McKenna, CEO of Walmart International, was also quoted in the statement as supporting a potential public listing of Seiyu with Walmart retaining majority ownership. Under Walmart, Seiyu has closed unprofitable stores. It also teamed up with Rakuten Inc last year to launch an online grocery venture, facing off against rivals such as Amazon’s Fresh service.

5766,"TOKYO   - Japan’s Nomura Holdings Inc won shareholder approval on Monday for the re-appointment of its chief executive officer, overcoming concerns about the leaking of market information and its first annual loss in a decade. CEO Koji Nagai kept his job despite opposition from influential proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc, which had recommended shareholders vote against his re-appointment.  The vote was in effect an endorsement of Nagai’s efforts to turn around the investment bank, which reported an annual loss in April and said it would not pay out bonuses to directors. Nomura was ordered by the financial watchdog last month to improve its internal controls following the leak of information related to listing and delisting criteria at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  “We sincerely apologize for causing great trouble and worry to investors,” Nagai told the annual general meeting on Monday. All the executives on stage bowed in contrition following his remarks. The meeting lasted for more than three hours as shareholders threw questions at executives. When asked why he did not resign, Nagai said he felt a duty to “steadily proceed with business improvement measures”. Nomura has said an employee from its Nomura Research Institute affiliate leaked information about expected changes to listing rules to the chief strategist of its securities arm, who informed sales staff. The sales staff then told clients. Nagai, who became the group CEO in 2012, has said he will take a 30% pay cut for three months over the scandal.     While Nomura’s share price has been trending down, it surged more than 10% last week after the firm announced a $1.4 billion buyback. It rose 0.3% in Monday’s trading.

5790,"SHANGHAI   - Instead of waging a trade war with China, the United States should drop its win-at-all-costs mentality and consider the interests of its own people as well as the global community, the official People’s Daily said an editorial on Saturday. The Chinese Communist Party’s newspaper urged the United States to cancel all tariffs on Chinese goods, saying the only way to resolve trade issues was through “equal dialogue”. Hopes that the two sides can rekindle negotiations were raised in the run-up to a meeting next week between President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Donald Trump in Japan, where they will both attend a Group of 20 summit.    The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is holding seven days of hearings from manufacturers and other businesses likely to be affected by a new round of tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The People’s Daily said all previous hearings had shown “overwhelming” opposition to tariff increases from all walks of life, but it had made no difference.       “It seems that some people in the United States are waving the tariff stick in order to strengthen their so-called ‘industrial competitive advantage’,” it said.  “They do not consider public opinion, do not consider national conditions, and do not take the international economic order into account. They just want the renown as ‘winners’ but cannot understand the fact that they basically cannot win.” The U.S. National Retail Federation (NRF) said on Friday that the proposed tariff extension on Chinese goods, including cellphones and computers, could cost U.S. consumers an additional $12.2 billion each year.

5853,"  - The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday said it would continue to defend President Donald Trump’s decision to make immigrants who enter the country illegally from Mexico ineligible for asylum, after a federal judge temporarily blocked the policy. Trump cited an overwhelmed immigration system for his recent proclamation that officials will only process asylum claims for migrants who present themselves at an official entry point along the U.S.-Mexico frontier.  But civil rights groups sued, and on Monday U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco issued a temporary restraining order saying Congress has clearly allowed immigrants to apply for asylum regardless of how they entered the country. The Justice Department on Tuesday said it was “absurd” that Tigar allowed civil rights groups to have the ability “to stop the entire federal government from acting so that illegal aliens can receive a government benefit to which they are not entitled.” The asylum ruling came as thousands of Central Americans, including a large number of children, are traveling in caravans toward the U.S. border to escape violence and poverty at home. Some have already arrived at Tijuana, a Mexican city on the border with California. “We look forward to continuing to defend the Executive Branch’s legitimate and well-reasoned exercise of its authority to address the crisis at our southern border,” the Justice Department said. In a statement after the ruling, American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt said Trump’s policy puts people’s lives in danger. “There is no justifiable reason to flatly deny people the right to apply for asylum, and we cannot send them back to danger based on the manner of their entry,” Gelernt said. Tigar, whose decision to block the asylum restriction marked the latest courtroom defeat for Trump on immigration policy, was nominated to the court by former President Barack Obama. His Monday order, which took effect immediately, applies nationwide and lasts until Dec. 19, when the judge scheduled a hearing to consider a more long-lasting injunction.

5875,"WASHINGTON   - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, pointing to underlying labor market strength despite a sharp slowdown in job growth in May. But the outlook for the economy continues to darken. Other data on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region stalled in June, likely reflecting a recent escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China.  The trade war has increased uncertainty over the U.S. economic outlook, prompting the Federal Reserve on Wednesday to signal it could cut interest rates by as much as half a percentage point over the rest of this year. The U.S. central bank kept rates unchanged on Wednesday. “Solid labor market conditions supporting a strong consumer sector provides a solid base underneath the economy,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000 for the week ended June 15, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would decrease to 220,000 in the latest week.  The Labor Department said no states were estimated. The drop in claims followed three straight weekly increases. Claims are being closely watched for signs of a rise in layoffs stemming from the trade dispute. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,000 to 218,750 last week.  The claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls component of June’s employment report. The four-week average of claims was little changed between the May and June survey periods. Still, economists expect payrolls to pick up in June after increasing by 75,000 jobs in May. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday acknowledged the meager job gains in May and said “in light of recent developments this bears watching,” but also noted that “many labor market indicators remain strong.” The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies as investors digested the Fed’s signal that it would ease monetary policy. Stocks on Wall Street rallied, with the S&P 500 index hitting a record intraday high. U.S. Treasury prices rose. Claims have been roughly flat this year, indicating some easing in labor market conditions. Job growth has cooled from the brisk pace in 2018 in line with the economy, which is slowing as the stimulus from last year’s massive tax cuts and increased government spending fades. “The recent flattening out in the data could be viewed as a negative change in momentum,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “But at least the recent trade developments haven’t led to a noticeable increase in filings for unemployment insurance.” The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product will rise at a 2.0% annualized rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the January-March quarter, boosted by a temporary burst in exports and an accumulation of inventories. The surge in exports, together with a decline in imports, helped to shrink the current account deficit in the first quarter to $130.4 billion from $143.9 billion in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said in a separate report on Thursday. Exports, however, tumbled in April in response to softening global demand. Weak exports and an inventory overhang, especially in the automotive sector, are hobbling manufacturing. Bottlenecks in the supply chain resulting from the U.S.-China trade war are also squeezing manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the economy. A third report on Thursday from the Philadelphia Fed showed its business conditions index dropped to a reading of 0.3 in June from 16.6 in May. There were decreases in measures of new orders, employment and shipments.  A gauge of prices received by manufacturers in the region tumbled to near a three-year low this month. A measure of prices paid by factories was also the lowest in nearly three years. These findings support expectations that inflation will remain muted this year.   The sharp braking in manufacturing in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware was the latest indication that national factory activity continues to slow. A report from the New York Fed earlier this week showed a record plunge in its Empire State manufacturing index to more than a 2-1/2-year low in June. But there are some rays of hope for manufacturing. The Philadelphia Fed survey’s six-month business conditions index rose to a reading of 21.4 this month from 19.7 in May. Its six-month capital expenditures index increased to 28.0 from a reading of 23.3 in the prior month. “We continue to expect manufacturing reacceleration,” said Samuel Coffin, an economist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut. “Confidence has declined, but we saw signs of an upturn in the last industrial production report.” ",U.S. labor market on solid ground;

5950,"  - Harley-Davidson Inc will partner with China’s Qianjiang Motorcycle Co to build a new smaller motorcycle than its trademark “big hogs”, making good on promises to move more production outside the United States that have angered President Donald Trump. Trump last year threatened to impose higher taxes on Harley after it made plans to move production for European customers overseas, part of a longer-term strategy for dealing with lower sales in the U.S. and higher costs because of trade tariffs. The partnership Harley outlined on Wednesday is aimed both at taking a bigger chunk of China’s huge bike and moped market, while also fitting in with a plan to cut costs and source half of all sales outside the United States by 2027. The new bike would have an engine displacement of 338 cubic centimeters, one of the smallest in the company’s 116-year old history, and would be sold in China from the end of 2020. Harley’s existing range of motorcycles are generally far larger and come with high price tags and engine capacities of more than 601 cubic centimeters.  That has made the company a niche seller in Asia’s big markets, where lightweight bikes and scooters dominate, and left it struggling to win over consumers globally to replace a traditional U.S. customer base which is aging. Harley declined to reveal a price range for the new motorbike, but Qianjiang said it would be “affordable” and Harley said it would be introduced elsewhere in Asia after the initial launch in China. “The international motorcycle market is huge, but Harley-Davidson has not been able to penetrate it with large/expensive bikes,” said Craig Kennison, an analyst with brokerage Baird. “Our recent dealer survey work reinforces the need for Harley-Davidson to add more first-time riders. For many, affordability is an issue.” Harley’s sales in China grew 27 percent in 2018 compared to 2017, and the company has already boosted investment at its Thailand plant to serve that market and avoid additional import duty. Harley said it had picked Qianjiang, owned by Chinese Volvo brand operator Geely, based on its experience developing upscale smaller motorcycles, supply base and knowledge of emerging markets. The company said in 2018 that it planned to launch lightweight motorcycles in Asia and electric bikes globally. It expects to launch its first electric motorcycle without the traditional clutch and gear-shift controls later this year. As part of a plan it calls “More Roads to Harley-Davidson”, the company expects to spend $675 million-$825 million over the next four years, cutting costs and generating $5.9 billion-$6.4 billion in revenue in 2022.

6005,"PARIS   - Airbus’ defense division is looking for new partners to expand its presence in the growing U.S. space market, and could potentially build components for a lunar program there, Airbus Defense and Space Chief Executive Dirk Hoke told Reuters. Airbus is ramping up production of more than 640 refrigerator-sized satellites for start-up telecoms services provider OneWeb at a facility in Florida, that Hoke said would already give it some leverage in the U.S. market. The company could also produce components in the United States for its European Support Module, a critical part of NASA’s Orion spacecraft, if that is modified as a module to access the moon, Hoke told Reuters at the Paris Airshow. “We’re also looking for new partners, with whom we could expand our footprint in the U.S.,” he said. “We have some very good products and systems so it’s worthwhile to look at what we can do beyond what we do currently in Europe.” Airbus’s defense and space division has long hoped to expand operations in the U.S. market, but lost out to Boeing Co  on a lucrative U.S. Air Force refueling plane contract in 2011. The company, which builds satellites and works with France’s Safran to build rocket launchers, now hopes the projected “new space” economy, which experts say could be worth $1 trillion a year, could give it another shot at a bigger U.S. role. Hoke faulted European leaders for failing to articulate a clear, unified vision for its ambitions in the space business, and said they were essentially ceding leadership to the United States and billionaire private investors, such as Elon Musk. “This is more than just a billionaire’s race to Mars. It is about having sovereign access to space, having access to resources in the long term, and of course, unfortunately, it is also a question of defense.” Failing to take action and jump start new research and development program would leave Europe “in the second and third row position,” he said, noting that it would also cause a brain drain of top talent. Rick Ambrose, head of U.S. arms maker Lockheed Martin’s space division, the lead contractor on the Orion spacecraft, told Reuters his company was in preliminary discussions with Airbus about possibly the adapting the European Support Module to bring humans to the moon and back to an orbiting lunar station. Ambrose said no decisions had been made, but it was “a logical conclusion” that some of the items developed by Airbus for the Orion spacecraft could be used to achieve U.S. President Donald Trump’s goal of putting humans back on the Moon by 2024. “Getting to the moon by 2024 means .... we’re going to have to reuse everything we can reuse,” he said at the air show.

6110,"OTTAWA/CALGARY, Alberta   - Canada looks set to approve a hotly-debated plan to expand an oil pipeline this week, people familiar with the process told Reuters, but the move is unlikely to help Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rebuild flagging support ahead of an October election. The Liberal government last year took the unprecedented step of buying the Trans Mountain pipeline from Kinder Morgan Canada for C$4.5 billion ($3.4 billion) to ensure the expansion went ahead to help solve crude transportation bottlenecks. If completed, the expansion would nearly triple capacity on the pipeline that runs from the western crude-rich province of Alberta to British Columbia’s Pacific coast. But it has faced increasing protests from environmental activists and aboriginal groups.  Trudeau - who came to power promising to improve Canada’s environmental record - faces a difficult decision. If he approves it, he could anger environmentalists and local residents who fear the impact of the project. If he rejects it, he risks further alienating an energy lobby that has accused him of wanting to wreck their industry as he has pressed ahead with plans to strengthen the environmental assessments of major new energy projects at a time of low prices. He has said the expansion will proceed if the conditions are right. His cabinet is set to take a final decision on Tuesday and Finance Minister Bill Morneau is due to address a business audience in the Albertan energy capital of Calgary on Wednesday. Two federal government insiders with knowledge of the situation said there was little doubt Ottawa would give the green light. “I am expecting an approval. Anything else would pose serious questions about what we are doing on the energy file,” said one of the sources, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. A senior Alberta government source also said approval was expected. “It’s the least this government can do to approve this pipeline,” said the source.  However, a senior federal government source insisted no decision had yet been taken and noted Ottawa had the power to push back the announcement. The office of the Prime Minister declined to comment. The cabinet will need to consider whether the project has done enough to win over aboriginal support. An original expansion plan approved by the Liberals in 2016 was overturned by a court which ruled the government had not adequately consulted indigenous groups. Ottawa says it has ramped up talks with aboriginal communities. Wood Mackenzie analyst Mark Oberstoetter said it was more than 50% likely that the government would move forward with Trans Mountain, given that a rejection “would be a hard story to tell your taxpayer base.” The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers has forecast total investment in Canada’s oil and natural gas industry will fall by about 10% to C$37 billion in 2019 from 2018, underscoring how Canada has struggled to recover from the 2014/15 global oil price crash. But even if it is approved, construction may not start any time soon, given the resistance by environmental and aboriginal groups. And an approval would do little to revive Liberal fortunes in Alberta, where the party looks set to lose all three of its parliamentary seats in October’s vote. At the same time, it could also enrage voters in British Columbia, where there are greater concerns about the potential impact of expansion and where the Liberals have 17 legislators. Significantly, many of those seats are in the Lower Mainland and connected to coastline that could be affected by the project, said Kathryn Harrison, political science professor at University of British Columbia. “There are significant risks for the Liberals in British Columbia,” she said.

6145,"MILAN   - Italy’s industry ministry is open to discussions with any investor interested in the rescue of troubled carrier Alitalia, including infrastructure group Atlantia, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Friday. The ministry is leading talks between the administrators managing the loss-making Alitalia and state-owned railway group Ferrovie dello Stato, which is trying to set up a consortium to buy the carrier.  So far Ferrovie has secured the commitment of Delta Air Lines but it is struggling to find another partner who is willing to invest more than 300 million euros ($336 million) in Alitalia, which has a long history of financial woes. An involvement of Atlantia could be a turning point in the rescue effort led by Ferrovie, but sources have previously said the plan still lacked a political green light. Atlantia is in bad terms with the governing coalition, in particular with the 5-Star Movement, after the deadly collapse of a motorway bridge it managed last August. 5-Star head Luigi Di Maio, who is also Italy’s industry minister, have blamed Atlantia for poor maintenance of the motorway network, adding the government would revoke the group’s motorway concession.

6153,"FRANKFURT   - Volkswagen aims to raise up to 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) by listing truck unit Traton, it said on Friday, scaling back earlier ambitions to list up to a quarter of the unit by opting to float a 10% stake. The German carmaker said in a statement that the offering would be priced at 27-33 euros per share, which Jefferies analysts said valued Traton at a slight discount to industry peers but at a premium to Swedish competitor Volvo. “We will now meet investors across the globe to convey our Traton story and the future potential of the group,” Traton Chief Executive Andreas Renschler said in a statement late on Friday after the publication of Traton’s IPO prospectus. “We are confident that we will then be able to ring the Stock Exchange bell before the end of June if the market stays reasonable.” Traton said that Swedish pension fund AMF Pensionsfoersaekring AB had agreed to become a cornerstone investor in the listing and subscribe to 200 million euros worth of Traton stock. Wolfsburg-based VW plans to invest proceeds in transforming its auto production as it readies the launch of dozens of electric vehicles over the coming years and deepens an alliance with Ford Motor Co. It is also seeking to capitalize on the premium that truck stocks command over automakers to create an acquisition currency, having earlier shown interest in U.S.-based truck maker Navistar. Management denies that a Navistar deal is in immediate prospect, but such a move would fit with a broader pivot by the leading European carmaker towards the United States to balance its reliance on China, where it sells half its cars. The stake size is at the bottom end of a range of 10%-20% that sources had earlier indicated. If banks running the deal exercise an over-allotment option, the issue size could reach 11.5% of Traton’s equity. At the offer range, the initial public offering values Traton at 13.5-16.5 billion euros. Shares in VW closed 1.1 percent lower on Friday as analysts cautioned that Traton’s potential acquisitiveness could lead to the issue of fresh equity that would dilute existing shareholdings. Jefferies, in a note, said that Traton’s enterprise value as a multiple of core earnings - a measure of a company’s ability to support its equity and debt costs - of 8.2 times was slightly lower than the sector average but higher than Volvo’s, which it sees as offering better value. The carmaker is being more cautious about the volume of shares it will place after halting earlier listing plans in March, when it had planned to place a stake of up to 25% on the stock market, citing market conditions. More shares could be sold subsequently if the IPO is successful, a person familiar with the matter said this month, adding VW would remain Traton’s majority shareholder for the foreseeable future. The offering will begin on Monday, with management holding a series of investor roadshows. It ends on June 27, with the first day of trading in Frankfurt and Stockholm set for June 28.

6349,"TAIPEI   - Foxconn, the world’s top contract electronics assembler, said it had enough capacity outside China to meet Apple’s demand in the American market if the need should arise for the iPhone maker to adjust its production lines due to the U.S.-China trade war. The comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to slap further tariffs on $300 billion worth of goods from China - where the bulk of Apple’s devices are assembled. The country is also a key market for the firm. “Twenty-five percent of our production capacity is outside of China and we have enough capacity to meet Apple’s demand in the U.S. market,” a member of the Taiwanese firm’s proposed new board, Liu Young-way, said on Tuesday. He added that if Apple needs, Foxconn could adjust its production lines accordingly.  Liu was speaking at Foxconn’s first investor conference in Taipei, where the company also said it was well positioned to tackle the “increasingly tough” trade war situation with its production lines across 16 countries.  The trade war “will have some impact, but it will be limited,” Liu said.    He also emphasized that Foxconn’s investment in Wisconsin was more important than before given the trade war. The firm is already under the spotlight for having failed so far to meet job-creation targets in the U.S. state. Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, also unveiled a leadership overhaul that will see more executives involved in its daily operations, as Chairman Terry Gou seeks to run in Taiwan’s 2020 presidential election. Reuters exclusively reported last week on the overhaul, which marks a major shift in Foxconn’s corporate leadership that has seen 68-year-old Gou hold a tight grip on the firm’s daily operations and strategic decisions. Gou told Reuters in April that he planned to step down from Foxconn to pave the way for younger talent to move up the ranks. Foxconn will now get an “operations committee”, that will give nine senior executives from the group’s subsidiaries greater control. It will meet once every week. The committee includes most members from Foxconn’s proposed new board, including Foxconn CFO Huang Chiu-lien and Foxconn Interconnect Technology Ltd Chairman Lu Sung-Ching. The committee did not include Gou or the chairman of Foxconn’s Japanese electronics unit Sharp Corp, Tai Jeng-wu, who are both members of the new proposed board.  Two people with direct knowledge of the matter said Tai had resigned from the committee to avoid possible conflict of interest between parent Foxconn and its Japanese unit. Foxconn did not provide a reason for Tai’s absence. Investors are keen for any insight into succession plans at Foxconn and what it means for plans laid out by Gou such as the $10 billion investment to create 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin and an $8.8 billion display factory in southern China. Liu said the Wisconsin investment, which is expected to reach $1.4-1.5 billion with up to 2,000 employees by end of 2020, was on schedule. He added the project, which includes manufacturing of displays and servers, was poised to go into production by end of next year.  He also sought to address investors’ long-time concerns about Foxconn’s approach to corporate transparency, saying the company plans to hold investor conferences twice a year. Foxconn shares have dropped around 20% since Gou announced in April his plans to run for president. They closed up 0.4% on Tuesday, in line with the broader index.

6398,"  - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that transgender issues were in flux and he aims to protect the country after a report that his administration was considering defining gender as male or female based on genitalia at birth drew widespread condemnation. “We have a lot of different concepts right now. They have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now,” Trump said amid a protest outside the White House and outpouring of criticism on social media about the proposal. Asked about a campaign promise to protect the LGBT community, Trump said: “I’m protecting everybody. I want to protect our country.” Under a proposal first reported by the New York Times on Sunday, the Trump administration would narrow the definition of gender to male or female at birth and it would be unchangeable later in life. The move would remove recognition of and protections for transgender people under U.S. civil rights laws promoted by the prior administration of President Barack Obama in health care, schools and the military. About 1.4 million U.S. adults identify as transgender, according to a 2016 estimate by the Williams Institute, a research center at UCLA Law School focused on sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy. The reported proposal comes little more than a week after New York City created a gender-neutral “X” option for birth certificates, joining California, Oregon, Washington state and New Jersey in offering a third gender category on the government-issued identity documents.       Medical experts said on Monday that defining gender based on genitalia at birth is scientifically inaccurate and may harm patients’ health. Dr. Joshua Safer, executive director of Mount Sinai Hospital’s Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery, said the Trump administration’s definition is “not consistent with current western medicine or science in terms of how we actually operate or define sex of individuals.” “Sex of individuals is not correlated always with their genitals at birth, or with their chromosomes,” said Safer, who also serves as president of the United States Professional Association for Transgender Health.  Most transgender people live with a profound sense that the gender assigned to them at birth was wrong and transition to the opposite sex, while others live a non-binary or gender-fluid life. “We urge the administration to ensure all public health policy is firmly rooted in science, and to keep discrimination and political interference out of our nation’s health,” said Dr. Lisa Hollier, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Beyond the broader issues raised by the administration memo, doctors said the new policy would be impossible to apply to “intersex” babies who are born with ambiguous genitalia or reproductive organs. “Trump’s definition does not even take this entire group of patients into consideration,” said Dr. Natasha Bhuyan, a family medicine and LGBT care specialist in Phoenix.  If the administration’s recommended definition is adopted, these patients will likely be assigned a male or female sex at birth, which can have devastating long-term psychological and health consequences, she said.

6517,"PARIS   - Kering, owner of brands including Gucci, will tighten its grip on its e-commerce operations, focusing on its own branded sites to sell its luxury products or ventures where it can control its image and client data. After shifting into online shopping later than more accessible fashion labels, many luxury groups are now investing heavily in e-commerce while working on ways of retaining as much control of distribution and pricing as possible - two elements that help them maintain their aura of exclusivity.  Kering had already said it would wrest back control of web operations for brands such as Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen which had been developed by Yoox Net-A-Porter (YNAP) - an online retailer now fully owned by the group’s rival Richemont. That joint venture with YNAP will take now end in the second quarter of next year, Kering’s digital officer Gregory Boutte explained on the sidelines of a group investor day on Friday. Seeking to boost sales and margins, the company is also looking to turn more of its collaborations with third-party, multi-brand retailers such as Farfetch or Matchesfashion.com into what it calls online concessions, where it controls everything from the product assortment to their presentation.  “Each time we move from wholesale to a concession we see our top line increase in a material way,” Boutte said. Kering was “not against wholesale,” and did not plan to end its relationships with third parties altogether, Boutte added. Kering, whose rivals also investing in e-commerce including Louis Vuitton owner LVMH, did not disclose how much it was spending on expanding these operations. Its digital team has grown from four people in 2017 to over 80 people now.  Boutte said Kering might be open to joining a blockchain technology platform which LVMH is developing to help track supplies chains and authenticate products in an industry that often has to grapple with counterfeit goods. Kering’s total online sales - when including the business done through third party platforms, calculated at retail and not at lower wholesale prices - came to 9.4 percent of the group’s 2018 revenue, it disclosed on Friday.  Web sales through its own brand websites and online concessions made up 4.7 percent of revenue, it added.  Across the luxury goods industry as a whole, e-commerce accounts for around 10 percent of business today and should reach 25 percent of sales by 2025, consultancy Bain estimates.

6740,"SYDNEY   - Australia’s biggest telecommunications provider Telstra Corp Ltd plans to cut a quarter of its contractors in two years, its CEO said on Tuesday, a reduction of 10,000 people on its payroll and adding to thousands of internal jobs slated to go. The newly disclosed cuts show the extent of the company’s focus on lowering overheads as cut-throat competition and new technology put pressure on its mainstay fixed-line businesses. The announcement came a week after the former government utility brought forward a plan to cut a quarter of its internal workforce, or 8,000 jobs, and forecast a A$500 million ($348.9 million) writedown on its ageing data-storage assets. “Over the past year we have also reduced our indirect workforce by 5,000 and we would anticipate reducing this further by over 25% in the next two years,” Telstra CEO Andy Penn said at an investor conference. Penn did not specify the number of jobs, but a Telstra spokesman referred Reuters to Penn’s comments earlier in 2019 when he said Telstra had 40,000 “industry partners who provide technology, consultancy and other services”. “The human dimension of these numbers is very challenging,” Penn added in the speech on Tuesday.      Telstra announced its job-cut plan last June and last week said it will have shed about 6,000 internal jobs, from 8,000 jobs it plans to cut, by the end of the financial year to June, bringing forward A$200 million in restructuring costs. The telco then added that it would take another A$350 million in restructuring charges in the following financial year.

6754,"SAN JOSE, Calif.   - Apple Inc on Monday launched a “Sign In With Apple” function to rival Facebook and Google web login accounts, drawing a contrast with rivals by stressing protection of users’ information. When users sign in with their Google or Facebook Inc profiles to third-party apps, the apps often share valuable data with Google and Facebook, a practice that Apple is looking to stop. Apple announced the move at its annual software developer conference in San Jose, California, where it also showed new features for its operating systems for iPhones, iPads and Macs and said it would retire the iTunes app after 18 years in favor of separate apps for music, movies and podcasts.  Privacy themes ran throughout the event, with Apple creating a system for its users to sign up for apps with a randomly generated email to avoid revealing their true address. The iPhone maker also tightened controls on location tracking, saying it would stop apps from scanning Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks to guess a user’s location even when the user has disabled tracking. Apple has emphasized privacy in effort to set itself from rivals such as Facebook and Google, both of whom use data to boost their advertising businesses and whose practices have come under scrutiny. “Location-based tracking, for example, is much more nefarious than most people realize,” said Bob O’Donnell, head of TECHnalysis Research. “You can find out more about someone from their location than things like what they’re searching for.”  Apple is unlikely to make any money directly off the new services, analysts said. Instead, features like the web sign-on are likely to drive brand loyalty by making it easier for users to log into apps without having to juggle multiple passwords, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. But Apple, whose iPhone sales have started to fall after nearly a decade of sustained growth, is also working to persuade consumers that its hardware is worth its higher price in part because it protects their data. Bajarin said Apple appears to be working to “firewall” off its customers from data collection practices it disagrees with. “You look at all these regulations that have come down...and the goal of them is to give consumers more control over their data.

6799,"SEOUL   - Korean Air Lines Co Ltd’s chief executive on Monday said ownership discussions are ongoing with family members after their patriarch’s sudden death in April raised questions about the future of the airline and parent Hanjin Group.  Listed holding company Hanjin Kal Corp has been led by 43-year-old Walter Cho since the death of his father, Chairman Cho Yang-ho. However, it has yet to inform regulators who will officially lead the group, whose businesses also include hotels, logistics and budget airlines. Cho’s widow and two daughters, as well as his son, own stakes in Hanjin Kal. “He told us harmony among family members is of utmost importance and what we must achieve through harmony is to protect the company,” CEO Cho said of his father at an annual meeting in Seoul of the International Air Transport Association. The late tycoon died aged 70 following chronic illness just weeks after shareholders ended his 27-year tenure on the airline’s board due to perceived leadership failings. The change at the top comes soon after a local activist fund raised its stake in Hanjin Kal to nearly 16%, bringing the group’s ownership structure to wider attention. The Cho family - including the late Cho’s 17.8% stake - and its academic foundations own 29%. Cho’s death left his family with an inheritance tax bill of around 170 billion won ($143.72 million), equal to about half his entire Hanjin Kal stake, some analysts estimated. CEO Cho declined to discuss the tax and management rights on Monday. The death also raised the possibility of a family war over the late Cho’s Hanjin Kal stake, though his family would likely fight to defend control of Korean Air, analysts said. “Since it appears the late chairman left no formal will, it’s crucial for Walter Cho and his sisters who own similar-sized stakes in Hanjin Kal to avoid any family feud aimed at becoming the biggest shareholder,” said Hi Investment & Securities senior analyst Lee Sang-hun. Asked how he would deal with growing competition in South Korea’s aviation industry, CEO Cho said the airline as been too passive in competing with fast-growing low-cost carriers and that he would adopt a more aggressive strategy. “Now they are interfering with our (full-service) side of the business and they are over-growing the size of the market,” Cho said. Korean Air’s operating profit fell more than 40% to 640 billion won in 2018 versus 2016, while profit at the country’s biggest budget carrier, Jeju Air Co Ltd, nearly doubled to 100 billion won over the same period, their stock exchange filings showed. Korean Air currently operates 168 aircraft serving 124 destinations. In October, it said it could order more wide-body jets this year, with Boeing Co 787 and Airbus SE A350 models in contention. Cho on Monday declined to specify the likely size of any order but said a purchasing decision would be made “imminently”.

6932,"ANAHEIM, Calif.   - Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Bob Iger told Reuters on Wednesday it would be “very difficult” for the media company to keep filming in Georgia if a new abortion law takes effect because many people will not want to work in the U.S. state. Disney has filmed blockbuster movies in Georgia such as “Black Panther” and “Avengers: Endgame,” and it would be a blow to the state’s efforts to create production jobs if the entertainment giant stopped filming there.    Georgia’s Republican governor signed into law on May 7 a ban on abortion after a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat - about six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. The law is due to take effect on Jan. 1, if it survives court challenges.  Asked if Disney would keep filming in Georgia, Iger said it would be “very difficult to do so” if the abortion law is implemented.  “I rather doubt we will,” Iger said in an interview ahead of the dedication for a new “Star Wars” section at Disneyland. “I think many people who work for us will not want to work there, and we will have to heed their wishes in that regard. Right now we are watching it very carefully.” If the law takes effect, “I don’t see how it’s practical for us to continue to shoot there,” he added.     Georgia is one of eight states to pass anti-abortion legislation this year for the purpose of inducing the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark case that established a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.  The state offers a tax credit that has lured many film and TV productions. The industry is responsible for more than 92,000 jobs in Georgia, according to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), and some 455 productions were shot in Georgia in 2018, according to the state.  Some actors and producers have already said they will no longer work in Georgia because of the abortion law, but many of the large production companies have remained publicly silent on the abortion law. On Tuesday, Netflix Inc said the streaming service would “rethink” its film and television production investment in Georgia if the law goes into effect.

In a rare rebuttal to Trump, Sessions said on Thursday that he “took control of the Department of Justice” the day he became attorney general, and that “the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.” In a tweet on Saturday morning, Trump replied that Sessions “doesn’t understand what is happening underneath his command position.” Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is running the Russia probe, is “highly conflicted” and “real corruption goes untouched,” Trump continued. Sessions, a former U.S. senator from Alabama, was one of the first Republican lawmakers to back Trump’s presidential election bid and has implemented his hardline immigration policies in the role of attorney general. But Trump has repeatedly criticized Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia probe, including in a Fox News interview taped on Wednesday when he said that Sessions “never took control of the Justice Department.”  Trump denies any collusion with Moscow and calls the investigation a “witch hunt.” The back-and-forth between Trump and Sessions has sparked new speculation that Trump might fire Sessions.

7357,"  - China’s Huawei believes Europe will not follow the United States in blacklisting the company because it has been a partner of European telecoms firms for many years, a top Huawei executive told an Italian newspaper. The U.S. government has imposed heavy restrictions on Huawei, accusing the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker of being vulnerable to involvement in activities contrary to national security or foreign policy interests. Huawei denies this, saying Washington has produced no evidence to back up its claims and that independent testing of its equipment shows no vulnerability to potential Chinese espionage. Huawei Vice-President Catherine Chen told newspaper Corriere della Sera in an interview published on Tuesday that the company had been working in Europe for 10 to 20 years, collaborating closely with telecoms firms on developing 5G networks. “We don’t think it can happen in Europe,” Chen said when asked if she was worried that European nations would bow to U.S. pressure to impose similar restrictions. “I believe they will take their own decisions independently,” she said. In a separate interview in Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore, Huawei’s Italy chief, Luigi De Vecchis, said Europe would set back its own efforts to develop 5G networks and to digitize its economies if it were to blacklist Huawei.

7485,"  - Boeing Co said on Thursday it had completed a software update for its 737 MAX jets, which have been grounded worldwide since March after they were involved in two fatal crashes. The planemaker said it was in the process of submitting a plan on pilot training to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and would work with the regulator to schedule its certification test flight. The FAA is planning a meeting on May 23 in Fort Worth, Texas, with regulators from around the world to update them on reviews of Boeing’s software fix and on pilot training. Aviation regulators from other countries will have to assess Boeing’s proposed fixes and clear the aircraft to fly in other regions independently of the FAA. It is unclear when the 737 MAX aircraft will return to service, but U.S. airlines have said they hope the jets will fly this summer. Southwest Airlines Co and American Airlines Group Inc, the two largest U.S. operators of the MAX, have pulled the jets from their schedules until Aug. 5 and Aug 19, respectively.  The airlines, which must still decide on pilot training, have said they would use the jets as spare planes if they are approved for flight before those dates. The FAA said on Thursday that Boeing had not yet submitted its final software package for approval. On Wednesday, acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said he expected Boeing to make its formal submission for its software update in the next week or so.  The 737 MAX was grounded following a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed all 157 on board just five months after a similar crash of a Lion Air flight killed 189 people. Boeing hopes the software upgrade and associated pilot training will add layers of protection to prevent erroneous data from triggering a system called MCAS, which was activated in both the planes before they crashed. The planemaker said it had completed simulator testing and engineering test flights as well as developed training and education materials, which were now being reviewed by the FAA, global regulators and airline customers.

7531,"FRANKFURT   - Euro zone banks are turning away from cross-border activity, putting at risk the bloc’s banking union and raising the risk of dangerous fragmentation, European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Thursday. With national rules hindering cross-border consolidation, the euro zone bank sector remains highly fragmented, leaving lenders unable to compete with bigger and more efficient global peers. Banks’ excessive reliance on their home market also ties their fortunes to the local economy, maintaining a so-called ‘doom loop’ between banks and their sovereigns, a major vulnerability exposed during the bloc’s debt crisis. “Euro area-based banks have substantially reduced their cross-border claims since the crisis, and about 60% of banks’ total exposures are to their home countries,” de Guindos told a conference in Brussels. “This is worrying at a time when the political momentum behind completing the banking union is fading,” he added.” This may lead banks to refocus their activities on their domestic markets as they anticipate that the banking union will remain incomplete, resulting in further fragmentation.” De Guindos said potential solutions could include the creation of a European safe asset, a proposal already put on the table by the bloc’s risk watchdog but not discussed in substance due to German opposition. Berlin fears that German taxpayers could be forced to pick up the cost of others’ financial irresponsibility. This is also the basis of German resistance to creating a euro zone-wide deposit insurance scheme, which would also improve banks’ cross border reach.   One option for a safe asset would be a synthetic bond, issued by a private investor and backed by the sovereign debt of each euro zone member. Such a construction would tie the bond to the performance of actual debt without putting any explicit legal burden on the governments that issue the underlying bond.  “If well-designed, such a European (safe) asset could become the benchmark for investors in EU capital markets, reduce the incentives for capital flight on national bonds within the euro area and contribute to lowering risks on banks’ balance sheets,” de Guindos said.

7567,"  - Macy’s Inc said on Wednesday the latest tariffs on Chinese imports by Washington are hitting its furniture business and warned investors that additional levies would leave its clothing and accessory categories vulnerable as well. The largest U.S. department store operator is one of the first to comment publicly on the damage that U.S. President Donald Trump imposing tariffs on all remaining imports from China, another $300 billion worth of goods, could have on business. In Macy’s case, the potential tariffs would impact both its private and national brands, Gennette said. Gennette said any escalation of tit-for-tat tariffs was not factored into the company’s annual outlook and that the company would do what it could to minimize the effect on customers. The executive said the company had worked hard to reduce reliance on Chinese suppliers. Washington dramatically escalated its 10-month trade war with Beijing on Friday by raising levies on $200 billion of Chinese goods in the midst of trade talks, and U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened new tariffs on all remaining U.S. imports from China, sending global financial markets into a tailspin. China retaliated on Monday, though on a smaller scale. Macy’s topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly same-store sales and profit benefiting from increased online sales and higher demand for items sold at its off-price stores. Macy’s shares, which have so far lost more than a quarter of their value this year, were down less than 1% at $21.61 in afternoon trading. Like its peers, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based department store chain, which has closed more than 100 stores since 2015 and cut thousands of jobs as mall traffic plummeted, faltered in the past few years as it struggled to adjust to a fiercely competitive retail landscape where shoppers buy more goods online at places like Amazon.com Inc. The 160-year-old retailer has poured money into building up its private label clothing as well as expand its off-price venture, Backstage, by adding 45 more stores this year. Gennette said brick-and-mortar sales trends improved sequentially in the first quarter, helped by its off-price Backstage business. The retailer said it saw double-digit growth in its digital business and that mobile continues to be Macy’s fastest-growing channel for sales growth. Sales at Macy’s stores open more than 12 months, including sales in department stores licensed to third parties, rose for the sixth straight quarter. They were up 0.7%, above the average analyst estimate of a 0.3% rise, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.  Gross margin in the quarter fell to 38.2% from 39%, because a delayed start to spring bloated inventories. Macy’s said it expects to see some gross margin pressure in the second quarter as it continues to clear excess spring products. Last quarter, Macy’s announced a plan focused on cost cuts for 2019 to speed up decision-making and result in an annual savings of $100 million. The company earned $136 million, or 44 cents per share, in the first quarter ended May 4, compared to $139 million, or 45 cents per share, a year ago. That exceeded the average analyst estimate of 33 cents. Net sales fell to $5.50 billion, roughly in line with analysts expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “With comp results coming in better-than-feared, we’d expect a modest relief rally out of Macy’s today, but would not be chasing the stock,” Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said in a note. The company also repeated its previously issued financial forecast for the year.

7701,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING   - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next month as the trade war between the world’s two largest economies intensified, sending shivers through global markets. China announced earlier it would impose higher tariffs on a range of U.S. goods, including frozen vegetables and liquefied natural gas, a move that followed Washington’s decision last week to hike its own levies on $200 billion in Chinese imports. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office said later it planned to hold a public hearing next month on the possibility of imposing duties of up to 25% on a further $300 billion worth of imports from China. Cellphones and laptops would be included in that list but pharmaceuticals would be excluded, the office said. The prospect that the United States and China were spiraling into a no-holds-barred dispute that could derail the global economy has rattled investors and led to a sharp selloff on equities markets in the past week. A gauge of global stocks shed a further 1.9% on Monday, its biggest one-day drop in more than five months. China’s yuan currency fell to its lowest level since December and oil futures slumped. Trump, who has embraced protectionism as part of an “America First” agenda, said he would talk to Xi at a G20 summit in late June. “Maybe something will happen,” Trump said in remarks at the White House. “We’re going to be meeting, as you know, at the G20 in Japan and that’ll be, I think, probably a very fruitful meeting.” Speaking several hours later at a dinner gathering at the White House, Trump said it should be clear in “three or four weeks” if a U.S. trade delegation’s trip to Beijing two weeks ago was successful.  “I have a feeling it’s going to be very successful,” Trump said. The Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councilor Wang Yi, said during a trip to Russia that China-U.S. talks were not a “one-way street” and needed to be conducted on the basis of equality, according to China’s Foreign Ministry. “Both countries’ negotiating teams have the ability and wisdom to resolve each other’s reasonable demands, and in the end reach a mutually beneficial, win-win agreement,” he said. The comment period on the planned new tranche of U.S. duties - which covers 3,805 product categories - is much shorter than in previous rounds and could potentially leave Trump in a position to trigger those tariffs by the time he meets Xi. U.S. farmers are among those most hurt by the trade war, with soybean sales to China plummeting and U.S. soybean futures hitting their lowest level in a decade. Trump said on Monday his administration was planning to provide about $15 billion to help farmers whose products might be targeted. Farmers, who are a core political constituency for Trump’s Republicans heading into the 2020 presidential and congressional elections, are growing increasingly frustrated with the protracted trade talks and the failure to reach an agreement. “What that means for soybean growers is that we’re losing,” Davie Stephens, president of the American Soybean Association, said in a statement. China said on Monday it planned to set import tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on 5,140 U.S. products on a $60 billion target list. It said the tariffs would take effect on June 1. “China’s adjustment on additional tariffs is a response to U.S. unilateralism and protectionism,” its finance ministry said. “China hopes the U.S. will get back to the right track of bilateral trade and economic consultations and meet with China halfway.” In the middle of the negotiations last week, Trump hiked tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%. The move affected 5,700 categories of Chinese products, including internet modems and routers. Sources have said talks stalled after China tried to delete commitments from a draft agreement that its laws would be changed to enact new policies on issues from intellectual property protection to forced technology transfers.   Beijing said on Monday it would never surrender to external pressure. Its state media kept up a steady drum beat of strongly worded commentary, reiterating that the door to talks was always open but vowing that China would defend its national interests and dignity. State television said in a commentary the effect of the U.S. tariffs on the Chinese economy was “totally controllable.” Trump has said he is in no rush to finalize a deal with China. He again defended the move to hike U.S. tariffs and said there was no reason why American consumers would pay the costs.  Economists and industry consultants, however, maintain that it is U.S. businesses that will pay the costs and likely pass them on to consumers. U.S. tariffs last year triggered retaliation by China, which imposed 25% levies on $50 billion worth of U.S. products including soybeans, beef and pork and lower tariffs on a list of $60 billion in goods. Goldman Sachs economists said in a research note new evidence showed the costs of Washington’s tariffs on China last year had fallen entirely on U.S. businesses and households, with no clear reduction in prices charged by Chinese exporters. They said the effects of the tariffs had spilled over noticeably to the prices charged by U.S. producers competing with goods affected by the levies.

7739,"WASHINGTON   - An upcoming report on the U.S. military supply chain will show the Pentagon depends on Chinese components for some military equipment, a top Defense Department official said on Friday. The industrial base report will show “there is a large focus on dependency on foreign countries for supply, and China figures very prominently,” the Defense Department’s chief buyer, Ellen Lord, told reporters in a briefing. She did not provide further detail but said the report is currently in the hands of the White House, and will be published within a month. When published, the report will come amid growing concerns from members of Congress and the U.S. intelligence community that Chinese telecommunications equipment is being used to spy on Americans. It is also the latest example of Pentagon efforts to deal with the military’s interactions with Chinese products. In April, the Defense Department stopped selling mobile phones and modems made by the Chinese technology companies Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp in stores on its military bases, citing potential security risks.

7953,"MEXICO CITY   - After a long push in Mexico, China’s Huawei landed a coveted job in 2017: supplying equipment for the country’s so-called “red compartida,” an ambitious telecommunications network built for carriers delivering the latest generation of technology. The contract came with a catch. Altan Redes, the company developing the network, announced that the most delicate work – involving the system’s “core” and sites near the U.S. border – would go to Nokia, and awarded Huawei southern and central Mexico. Political sensitivities around Huawei, which the United States has denounced since 2012 as an untrustworthy agent of the Chinese government, factored into the decision, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. But limiting Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s role was easier said than done. While sites along the U.S. border remain with Nokia, Huawei has since gained work in three cities in northern Mexican regions that Altan had said publicly would go to Nokia, according to four other people with knowledge of the matter and messages viewed by Reuters. Huawei began working in the cities late last year, one of the people said. The three cities - Tampico, Torreon and Culiacan – are located in northern Mexico but are not close the border. Altan’s plans for the network are fluid and could change, the sources noted.  Altan said in a statement that its decision to divide the work between Nokia and Huawei in that way was made “exclusively on technical and economic optimization criteria,” adding that it was not informed of U.S. concerns about Huawei. The company said no cities awarded to vendors were reassigned, and Huawei and Nokia “equally delivered their plans.” A U.S. State Department official said the department remains concerned that Chinese equipment in 5G networks could give the Chinese government access to sensitive data. A Huawei spokesman described the U.S. campaign as an effort to “attack and contain Huawei, without presenting any concrete evidence.” Huawei’s northward expansion in Altan’s network, previously unreported, underscores the Chinese firm’s combination of speed, manpower and technological sophistication, Mexican telecom executives say.  “It’s too late” to reverse Huawei’s strong presence in Mexico, said Marco Galvan, a senior director for trade group GSMA. Huawei’s potent appeal also shows how telecom operators globally are trying to balance the need for the Chinese company’s affordable and reliable equipment with the U.S. campaign to steer countries away from using its gear, Mexican telecom executives say. After acquiring two local wireless companies, AT&T removed Huawei equipment from sensitive parts of its Mexican network. But AT&T still uses the Chinese firm’s gear in the country, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That is due in part to Huawei’s deep bench and swift execution, the people said.  “When we upgraded our Mexico network to 4G LTE, we replaced Huawei in our data core network because we wanted a data core network design like we have in the United States,” AT&T Mexico said in a statement. The approaches taken by Altan and AT&T, detailed in interviews with two dozen people familiar with Huawei’s operations, point to new ground rules for working with the Chinese company in Mexico: Limit use of Huawei gear in “the core” - the brains of the cellular network that processes data from towers - and tread carefully along the border.  But some telecom experts say it is harder to wall off the core in the coming fifth generation, or 5G, networks. In its statement, Altan said the nearest Huawei cell site equipment is 1,549 km from the border town of Tijuana and 499 km from Matamoros, which neighbors Texas. “The equipment disperses a signal with a radius of 15 kilometers, so there is not even remotely close contact with the northern border,” Altan said.  Three people familiar with the decision said Altan gave the northern cities to Huawei following some problems with Nokia’s performance, including delays submitting documentation and slow response times.  Dimitri Diliani, Nokia’s global head of end-to-end solutions, said in an interview that the company met all key objectives and its share of the Altan project has not changed. “You always have hiccups and delays,” he said. “At the end of the day, we passed all of the hurdles.”  Specific cities were not assigned in the contract, Diliani said. It is not unusual for some cities to shift within large projects, a Nokia spokeswoman added. Cesar Funes, a Huawei vice president, said Mexican customers have asked the company for its response to the U.S. allegations, but business remains strong. He said he was not aware of whether Huawei had won work in the three cities but noted the company has managed to extend its reach in past projects. Vendors typically start with a certain share of a project, “but based on your performance, you could get more,” he said in an interview. “I have experienced that already in this country.” The U.S. government has intensified its fight against Huawei as countries prepare to deploy 5G networks, which will serve as the gateway to new technological frontiers such as self-driving cars and internet-connected appliances. Altan’s wholesale network, which offers capacity to retail telecom competitors in Mexico, is prepared to quickly transition to 5G, the company has said. As early as the 1990s, Huawei executives began pitching their services in Mexico. Competing aggressively on price and recruiting talent, Huawei eventually won big swaths of the market, supplying virtually all major players, including Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim’s America Movil. The wholesale network, part of a 2013-14 telecom reform aimed at promoting competition, was an enticing opportunity for Huawei to build a cutting-edge network from scratch, Funes said. Backed by a fund managed by Morgan Stanley Infrastructure and IFC Asset Management Company’s China-Mexico Fund, Altan won a tender to launch the network in 2016.   The prospect of Chinese participation in a sophisticated national telecom network attracted U.S. scrutiny early on. The U.S. State Department met with Mexico’s ministry for communications and transportation twice in 2016 to voice concerns about Huawei’s potential involvement in the project, according to a former senior U.S. State Department official.  The State Department did not ask Mexico to ban Huawei, but it did warn Mexican officials of security risks posed by the Chinese firm, the former official said. Some Mexican officials questioned why the United States was so concerned since AT&T was working with Huawei in the country, the former official recalled. Salma Jalife, Mexico’s undersecretary for communications and technological development, declined to comment. The State Department also met with Mexico’s Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), which regulates the industry, in late 2016 to discuss concerns regarding Huawei’s potential participation in the network, especially along the border, according to a Mexican official. A U.S. State Department official said the government works closely with Mexico and declined to comment on specific meetings. An IFT spokeswoman declined to comment. The Huawei spokesman stressed the company’s independence from the Chinese government. Altan ultimately struck its compromise, tapping both Huawei and Nokia. “The balance of the allocation of infrastructure between the technological providers is optimal, avoiding an exclusive dependence on either one,” Altan said in a statement. Most carriers in Mexico are still sold on Huawei, said Galvan of GSMA. “(Huawei) brought as many resources as necessary to Mexico from China,” he said. “They did what it takes.”  ",U.S. campaign

8104,"CHICAGO   - U.S. President Donald Trump says China pays the tariffs he has imposed on $250 billion of Chinese exports to the United States but that is not exactly the way tariffs work.  “For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA,” Trump tweeted on Sunday, saying he would raise tariffs again amid stalled negotiations on a trade deal with China. But Trump’s tariffs are not paid by the Chinese government or companies located in China. They are paid by importers of Chinese goods - usually U.S. companies or the U.S.-registered units of foreign companies. Importers often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers, for the most part manufacturers and consumers in the United States. Trump has often repeated that China pays for U.S. tariffs on its goods. “We have billions of dollars coming into our Treasury — billions — from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our Treasury; now we have billions coming in,” he said on Jan. 24. Trump, who has called himself the “Tariff Man,” said on Sunday he will raise tariffs on Friday to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods. He has already imposed tariffs of 25 percent on $50 billion of Chinese imports. Global steel and aluminum imports and shipments of washing machines and solar panels are also subject to tariffs Trump has levied since January 2018. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collects the tax on imports. The agency typically requires importers to pay duties within 10 days of their shipments clearing customs.     Through mid-March, Washington has netted $15.6 billion through tariffs imposed since early 2018, according to data from the CBP. Total tariff revenue - including levies that pre-dated Trump - shot up by 89 percent in the first half of the current fiscal year starting Oct. 1, to a total of $34.7 billion, according to U.S. Treasury data. Every item imported into the United States legally has a customs code. Importers are expected to check the tariffs and other taxes and duties due on the goods they bring in, calculate what they owe, and pay it. U.S. Customs reviews payments and sends importers a fresh bill if it detects underpayment. Importers also have to post payment guarantees, or import bonds, with customs. The costs of these bonds have risen with tariffs, an additional burden on U.S.-based firms importing goods from China.     Chinese suppliers do shoulder some of the cost of U.S. tariffs in indirect ways. Exporters sometimes, for instance, are forced to offer U.S. importers a discount to help defray the costs of higher U.S. duties. Chinese companies might also lose business if U.S. importers find another tariff-free source of the same goods outside China. But U.S.-based importers are managing the higher tax burden in a number of ways that hurt U.S. companies and customers more than China.  Such strategies include accepting a lower profit margin; cutting costs - including wages and jobs for U.S. workers; and passing on tariff costs through higher prices for U.S. consumers or companies. Most importers use a mix of such tactics to spread the higher costs among suppliers, consumers or buyers. Higher duties on imports of metals and Chinese products, for example, increased Caterpillar’s production costs by more than $100 million last year. In response, the heavy-duty equipment maker increased prices for its products. Tractor manufacturer Deere & Co estimates a $100 million increase in its raw materials costs this year because of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports. Deere has cut costs and increased prices to protect its profits. A Congressional Research Service report in February found that the tariffs led to increases in washing machine prices of as much as 12 percent, compared to January 2018, before tariffs took effect. Steel and aluminum tariffs increased the price of steel products by nearly 9 percent last year, pushing up costs for steel users by $5.6 billion, according to a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. U.S. companies and consumers paid $3 billion a month in additional taxes because of tariffs on Chinese goods and on aluminum and steel from around the globe, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University, and Columbia University. Companies shouldered an additional $1.4 billion in costs related to lost efficiency in 2018, the study found. China has retaliated against U.S. tariffs by imposing its own tariffs on imports from the United States. Most importers in China are Chinese. So in the same way the U.S. government collects import taxes on Chinese goods from U.S. importers, the Chinese government takes in taxes on U.S. goods from Chinese importers.  As with tariffs in the United States, Chinese firms can seek to pass on the costs to U.S. exporters. Some U.S. interests have lost business, such as U.S. soy farmers. Chinese buyers have cut billions of dollars of soybeans purchases from the United States because Chin’s tariffs have made U.S. supplies more expensive than beans from competitors such as Brazil.

8159,"  - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he would raise tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese imports by the end of the week. Trump has rattled the world trade order by imposing unilateral tariffs to combat what he calls unfair trade practices by China, the European Union and other major trading partners of the United States. The U.S. government hit China with the most extensive tariffs, starting a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on imports from the United States. Neither side has raised tariffs since Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Argentina in November 2018 and agreed to a truce while their teams negotiated an end to the trade war. Here is a rundown of major U.S. tariff actions and retaliatory measures since January 2018. - 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese technology goods including machinery, semiconductors, autos, aircraft parts and intermediate electronics components imposed on July 6 and Aug. 23 as part of “Section 301” probe into China’s intellectual property practices. - 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods including chemicals, building materials, furniture and some consumer electronics, imposed on Sept. 24 as a response to Chinese retaliation. The levy on these imports is scheduled to increase on increase to 25 percent on May 10. - Trump said on Sunday he would impose tariffs on an additional $325 billion worth of Chinese goods. The U.S. imported just under $540 billion of Chinese goods in 2018. So tariffs on $325 billion on top of the $250 billion of goods already subject to the import tax would likely cover all 2019 imports- including cell phones, computers, clothing, footwear and other consumer products. - 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods including soybeans, beef, pork, seafood, vegetables, whiskey, ethanol, imposed on July 6 and Aug. 23 in retaliation for initial rounds of U.S. tariffs. China has suspended a 25 percent duty on U.S. auto imports during their trade negotiations. Beijing has resumed some purchases of U.S. soybeans but has not formally suspended those tariffs. - Tariffs of 5 percent to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, including liquefied natural gas, chemicals, frozen vegetables and food ingredients, imposed on Sept. 24. - Based on 2018 U.S. Census Bureau trade data, China would only have about $10 billion in U.S. imports left to levy in retaliation for any future U.S. tariffs. Retaliation could come in other forms, such as increased regulatory hurdles for U.S. companies doing business in China. - 25 percent tariffs on imported steel and 10 percent tariffs on imported aluminum, imposed on March 23, 2018 on national security grounds. Exemptions have been granted to Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Korea in exchange for quotas, and negotiations over quotas continue with Canada, Mexico and the European Union. - 20 percent to 50 percent tariffs on imported washing machines, imposed on Jan. 22, 2018 as a “global safeguard” action to protect U.S. producers Whirlpool Corp and GE Appliances, a unit of China’s Haier Electronics Group Co Ltd. - 30 percent tariffs on imported solar panels, imposed on Jan. 22, 2018 as a “global safeguard” action to protect U.S. producers Solar World, based in Germany, and Suniva, owned by China’s Shunfeng International Clean Energy Ltd. - Trump is considering tariffs of around 25 percent on imported cars and auto parts, based on a U.S. Commerce Department study of whether such imports threaten U.S. national security. The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement protects Canadian and Mexican production in the event of such tariffs through a quota system. Trump has pledged not to impose auto tariffs on Japan and the European Union while trade negotiations with those partners are underway. - Canada on July 1 imposed tariffs tinyurl.com/y8w5g895 on $12.6 billion worth of U.S. goods, including steel, aluminum, coffee, ketchup and bourbon whiskey in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.  - Mexico on June 5 imposed tariffs of up to 25 percent on American steel, pork, cheese, apples, potatoes and bourbon, in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Mexican metals. - The European Union on June 22 imposed import duties here of 25 percent on a $2.8 billion range of imports from the United States in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum. Targeted U.S. products include Harley-Davidson motorcycles, bourbon, peanuts, blue jeans, steel and aluminum. - India, the world’s biggest buyer of U.S. almonds, on June 21 raised import duties on the nuts by 20 percent and increased tariffs on a range of other farm products and U.S. iron and steel, in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Indian steel. - Trump said last month that he would end preferential trade treatment for India, which would result in U.S. tariffs on up to $5.6 billion of imports from India.

Risk sentiment is likely to be on because the Fed is likely to remain on hold because you would need to see a string of higher job numbers at this level for the Fed to consider raising rates. “At this point I would view it as the economy is looking fairly strong and inflation pressure are subdued, which is bullish for the stock market. “Historically when the unemployment rate is so low that does reduce equity returns going forward. So that’s the tricky part of investing right now, balancing the fact that you have a strong economy with the fact that unemployment at historically low levels could be a contrary indicator.” “This is consistent with an economy that is going from 3.2% growth at the start of 2019 to 2.2% at the end of it.  The headline number looks pretty good which is driven by a drop in the participation rate. If the economy slows, you drop out of participation on the margin. There is no reason for the Fed to cut. There is no serious slowing in economic activity. There’s nothing to worry about with inflation looking at the moderate wage gains. Meanwhile, the latest report suggests there would be no significant move in housing stock given the modest increase in construction hiring. Underneath it all, things are healthy, but the economy is gradually slowing. Looking ahead, the part-time employment has been flat so it’s steady as she goes.” CHARLIE RIPLEY, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, ALLIANZ INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, MINNEAPOLIS:  “The volatility in equities is somewhat reasonable given the headline numbers were pretty surprising and very positive in this environment. It really reiterates Powell’s message on Wednesday, that the economy is in really good shape and inflation is low and that there isn’t any need to make changes to policy right now.”  “The unemployment rate is at its lowest since 1969, just goes to show that the people in the U.S. are getting jobs and the big picture suggests the economy doesn’t seem to swimming upstream. This is sort of a goldilocks environment for the U.S. economy right now.”  “You have an environment where the economy is doing well and inflation remains steady there is really no evidence that inflation will move higher so I don’t think there is a need to continue to push interest rates up this year.”  “The market was disappointed with the Fed not coming out and signaling a rate cut just to keep the economy moving but in the Fed’s view they really don’t need to do that and this report is evidence of that. The economy is doing quite well, the Fed really didn’t change anything, it’s just the markets that got it all wrong to price in a rate cut.” TOM DI GALOMA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SEAPORT GLOBAL, NEW YORK: “I think generally clients were set up for this trade. There’s been some liquidations going on for the last couple of days based on the perception that this number’s going to be a strong data set for the most part. My sense is that buyers are going to be around just because the data wasn’t so out of whack and we’ve gotten back to levels where accounts want to buy the market.” “It was a pretty solid jobs report, better than expectations. It was  good across the board in all the ways that matter.” “There’s nothing in the labor market that looks like a recession is on the horizon. Powell wasn’t dovish enough for the market on Wednesday. This fairly strong jobs report may be looked at with a little market skepticism. It’s just another data point that tells us a first rate cut from the Fed isn’t coming any time soon ... It’s almost become more about the Fed reaction function than the underlying data.” JACOB OUBINA, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST AT RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: “From a headcount standpoint, it blew the doors off the bus. The declining unemployment rate was not surprising to us. The labor force participation rate was a little bit high given demographic forces over recent months and you can see it kind of veered off of trend a bit. There has been a normalization there. “This will obviously have an effect on the view that the Fed will cut rates this year. This unemployment rate is going to do a lot to dissuade you of that thesis. “You’re firing on all cylinders in terms of the dual mandate. You’ve got average hourly earnings at 3.2 (percent) – that was a touch softer, but you had a revision to the prior month. 3.2 (percent) is clearly responding to lower rates of unemployment. There are wage pressures in the system. And so at some point that is going to lead to a wage push inflation narrative where companies are going to try to defend margins as these compensation costs get larger.  “This tells you that there’s a lot more capacity than people think for the economy to continue growing above trend.”  MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA: “With employment creation coming well above consensus market expectation and the unemployment rate dipping lower, April’s Jobs report confirmed that the labor market remains in a very good place. This is particularly good news for American households, notwithstanding the surprising absence of an uptick in wage growth. And it will help ensure that the U.S. economy continues to outperform other advanced countries.” JJ KINAHAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO: “Really solid. Hard to find fault. I find it interesting we had that bump on the S&P’s and they came back to where they were. The bond market hasn’t moved. But from the economy point of view, this is very, very solid. It supports a little bit of what (Federal Reserve Chair Jerome) Powell said that those who were hoping for him to talk about a rate cut, employment is certainly continuing at an amazing pace.  “When you see the lowest unemployment rate since December of 1969 that is impressive. The one thing that stood out to me in this report that was really solid is the fact we were worried about construction jobs the last couple of months. They came back in a very nice way this time. Retail down a little bit, not necessarily surprising as companies, as you see in the earnings reports, continue to try and figure out the brick and mortar versus online. “Powell was smart to say we are going to stand pat. His inflationary comments are really what got people because they were like how could you say this is just transitory on low inflation. At some point, it is going to come back. We have seen what has happened to crude oil over the last week and a half giving back a good percentage of its gains over the past month or so and that is the biggest area of inflationary pressures so we will see.  “The wage number here, some people were looking for a little bit higher on that, so that is the other thing in this report that is not what some people want. There is a little bit of human nature, the market is actually going so well that as we keep hitting highs people start expecting the bad news to come.

8216,"NEW YORK   - Tesla Inc should find no shortage of demand for the $1.35 billion convertible bond the electric carmaker is selling even though the terms it is offering look inferior on paper to a similar deal two years ago, bond investors said Thursday. And Tesla’s volatile and broadly underperforming stock is one reason why, they said. Convertible securities feature the income and protections of a low-yielding bond but offer the potential to profit far more from a jump in the stock price that triggers repayment in shares rather than cash.  In the new deal, being sold alongside $650 million in new shares, Tesla is looking to offer an interest rate below the coupon on its previous convertible from two years ago, even though interest rates today are broadly higher. There is also a higher bar for taking advantage of the stock price.  Investors, however, said the new deal in fact looks appealing when compared with Tesla’s existing convertibles, which now feature even leaner yields and, because the stock has been so wobbly, an even lower chance at striking a rich equity conversion before those bonds mature in the next three years. “With this new bond, you have five years until the bond is supposed to pay off. They don’t have to be successful, they don’t have to hit a home run. They just have to stay in business to refinance this in five years,” said Geoffrey Dancey, managing partner and portfolio manager at Cutler Capital Management.      The fundraising - which could top $2 billion in total - is easing Wall Street concerns about the carmaker, which has struggled to maintain profitability, and its ability to overcome a drop in sales and build new product lines. Tesla shares, which had fallen by nearly 10% in the two years since its last convertible was sold, ended more than 4% higher on Thursday. The new convertible bond is seen carrying a coupon of between 1.5% and 2.0% with a conversion premium of between 27.5% and 32.5% over the reference price for Tesla shares at the time of the sale, according to a trader who saw preliminary marketing materials for the deal on Thursday.  While those appear to be poorer terms for investors than the 2.375% coupon on the $977.5 million convertible bond maturing in March 2022, it is superior to the current yield to maturity on that 2022 bond at around 1%, Dancey said.  On its face, the conversion premium being touted, with a midpoint at 30%, also compares unfavorably to the 2022 bond’s lower conversion premium of 25%. But the underperformance of the stock, which closed at $244.10 on Thursday, means holders of the 2022 bond need at least a 34% rise in the stock to a price of$327.50 in order to trigger a conversion. “The terms of the convertible look reasonable, and I don’t think they’ll have any issue selling,” said Dancey, who may buy some of the new bonds. He does not have an existing position. Another boost to demand could come from the legion of short sellers of Tesla shares who often buy convertibles as a hedge, a common arbitrage used by hedge funds, said Eli Pars, co-chief investment officer at Calamos Investments. More than 25% of Tesla’s public float of stock is sold short.     “I haven’t heard anything that would make me think this would have any trouble getting done,” Pars said. Calamos has positions in convertibles from both Tesla and its solar panel-making unit, Solar City, according to its most recent SEC filing.  “With convertible bonds there are many opportunities for things to turn out OK,” he said.    Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment manager Gerber Kawasaki, known for his bullish positions on Tesla said the “noise” surrounding Tesla - including Chief Executive Elon Musk’s recent court fight with the SEC over his tweets - had rattled some of his clients.   “When we build a portfolio, Tesla will be a part of it. But what we’ll probably be doing is adding more on the convertible side not on the equity side,” he said.

8227,"  - Web hosting company GoDaddy Inc reported first-quarter profit below Wall Street expectations on Thursday, weighed down by persistent rising costs and slower customer growth, sending its shares 6 percent lower in after-hours trading. GoDaddy has been pressured by higher costs since it went public in 2015 as it expands its international customer base and spends on marketing and product development. GoDaddy, which manages roughly a fifth of all global domains, said total costs rose nearly 14 percent to $691.2 million, compared with average estimates of $436.93 million based on consensus from 12 analysts, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Shares fell as much as 6.3 percent to $76. Net income attributable to the company rose to $12.9 million, or 7 cents per Class A share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $3.3 million, or 2 cents per Class A share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 10 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total revenue rose to $710 million from $633.2 million, but was short of analysts’ expectations of $711.2 million. GoDaddy added 6.4 percent more customers in the quarter, which was much lower than 17.4 percent new customers in the year-ago period. Average revenue per user grew to $150, up 8.5 percent from the last year. For the second-quarter, GoDaddy said it expects revenue to be between $730 million to $740 million, the mid-point of which was above Wall Street expectations of $733.5 million. The company reaffirmed full-year revenue forecast in the range of $2.97 billion to $3 billion.

8292,"NEW YORK   - Allergan Plc shareholders have voted down a nonbinding proposal that sought an immediate split of the roles of chairman and chief executive, with 61.3 percent of shareholders backing Chairman and CEO Brent Saunders. Billionaire investor David Tepper’s hedge fund Appaloosa LP made the proposal, arguing that drugmaker Allergan currently has a questionable business strategy and excessive pay for executives. Proxy advisory firms backed keeping the current structure. However, Appaloosa’s success in attracting the votes of a substantial minority highlights the displeasure of many investors. The voting results represent 85.9 percent of shares eligible to vote, Allergan said in a statement on Wednesday. “Allergan shareholders are clearly dissatisfied with management’s performance, business strategy and board oversight, as nearly 40 percent of voting shareholders want more pressing change than what the board is offering,” Appaloosa said in a statement. The hedge fund said it still believes that separating the chairman and chief executive roles is a necessary first step “toward arresting the steady decline of what was once a great company”. A large number of investors are left frustrated as the vote was “clearly” helped by proxy advisor recommendations, noted RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky. Allergan, under pressure to rescue the company’s falling stock price, launched a review of its strategy last year. But that review is only likely to result in the sale of its  relatively small infectious disease unit. Appaloosa has voiced its discontent with the results of the review, and called for a breakup or sale of the company, citing recent clinical failures such as that of its depression treatment rapastinel. In an effort to fend off Appaloosa, Allergan agreed in March to split the chairman and CEO roles, but only at its next leadership change. Saunders, 49, has no plans to step down, a source close to the company told Reuters then. The company has also replaced more than half of its board since 2017. Saunders put together the current version of Allergan through a series of deals to roll up several pharmaceutical companies in 2014, and has run the company since then. He built his reputation as a dealmaker, but he has struggled since Pfizer Inc walked away from a $160 billion deal to buy Allergan in 2016. Allergan’s shares have lost nearly half their value since then. The company’s shares were down 1.5 percent at $144.8 in late morning trading. “The existing strategy has clearly not worked, the pipeline has disappointed meaningfully and needs to be replenished and the current platform is unfocused,” said Stanicky, adding that a lack of change in strategy would further pressure shares. Allergan is set to report its first-quarter earnings next Tuesday. Reuters on Tuesday had reported that enough votes had been cast for Allergan to prevail against Appaloosa.

8394,"  - Oil prices are likely to stay buoyant this year as the U.S. decision to end waivers on Iranian oil and OPEC output curbs are expected to keep supply tight, a Reuters survey showed on Tuesday. A monthly survey of 31 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude would average $68.57 a barrel in 2019, more than 2 percent higher than the $67.12 forecast in the previous poll in March.  U.S. light crude is seen averaging $60.23 per barrel this year, compared with $58.92 forecast in March. The latest figures are the highest projections this year as analysts raised oil forecasts for a second straight month. “The elimination of U.S. waivers for Iran will take another 0.5-1 million barrels per day from the oil market,” said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW. “Together with political tensions in Libya and chaos in Venezuela this will make the tight situation on the supply side of the oil market even tighter. There is no doubt that high oil prices are here to stay!” Oil has already rallied about 40 percent since the beginning of the year mainly helped by a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia to curb output.  To compensate for the reduced supply from Iran, the United States is pressuring OPEC to raise output. “If OPEC and its non-OPEC allies led by Russia do not make an allowance for on-going unplanned outages in Venezuela and Iran, they could run the risk of over-tightening the oil market should they decide to roll over production cuts when they meet again in Vienna in June,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, strategist at BNP Paribas. A majority of analysts who participated in the poll expect OPEC cuts to be extended until the end of the year, but at the same time they expect the group to recoup deteriorating output from Venezuela and Iran. “Our expectation is for OPEC+ output to increase in the second half of 2019 as members chase higher oil prices but ultimately will contribute to an oversupplied market,” said Edward Bell of Emirates NBD bank. Brent is expected to average around $70 per barrel in the second and third quarters of this year, but fall slightly to near $69 by year-end due to rising production from the United States and lingering concerns over economic growth. “We expect U.S. oil output to increase in 2019 as logistical bottlenecks continue to clear and recent high prices encourage drilling,” said Capital Economics analyst Caroline Bain. U.S. crude oil output from seven major shale formations is expected to rise to a record 8.46 million bpd in May, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Growth in global oil demand is expected to ease to 1-1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) this year from 1.2–1.5 million bpd forecast in the March poll.

8447,"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday asked the Trump administration to offer its views on whether it should hear Google’s bid to end Oracle Corp’s copyright infringement lawsuit involving the Android operating system that runs most of the world’s smartphones. The justices are considering whether to take up Google’s appeal of a lower court ruling reviving the lawsuit. Oracle has sought about $9 billion in damages.  A jury cleared Google in 2016, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which specializes in intellectual property disputes, overturned that decision in 2018, finding Google impermissibly used Oracle’s software code in Android under U.S. copyright law. The case, which could help define the level of copyright protection for software, dates back to 2010 when Oracle sued in San Francisco federal court, accusing Google of harming its business by copying thousands of lines of computer code from its popular Java programming language without a license in order to make Android. Google, part of Alphabet Inc, said an Oracle victory would chill software innovation.  The case has whipsawed since the start with Google twice losing at the Federal Circuit. In 2014, that court reversed a federal judge’s ruling that Oracle’s interfaces could not be copyrighted.  The Federal Circuit last year rejected Google’s argument that its use of Oracle’s “application programming interfaces” was permitted under the so-called fair use doctrine of the 1976 Copyright Act because by adapting them to a mobile platform it transformed them into something new.  The Supreme Court occasionally asks a president’s administration for advice on whether to take up a particular case. The court in 2015 rebuffed a previous Google appeal in the case after the Justice Department under President Barack Obama recommended against hearing it.  The justices did not give President Donald Trump’s Justice Department a deadline for its response in the case.

8508,"BONN   - Bayer shareholders vented their anger over its stock price slump on Friday as litigation risks mount from the German drugmaker’s $63 billion takeover of seed maker Monsanto. Several large investors said they will not support aspirin investor Bayer’s management in a key vote scheduled for the end of its annual general meeting. Bayer’s management, led by chief executive Werner Baumann, could see an embarrassing plunge in approval ratings, down from 97 percent at last year’s AGM, which was held shortly before the Monsanto takeover closed in June. A vote to ratify the board’s actions features prominently at every German AGM. Although it has no bearing on management’s liability, it is seen as a key gauge of shareholder sentiment. “Due to the continued negative development at Bayer, high legal risks and a massive share price slump, we refuse to ratify the management board and supervisory board’s actions during the business year,” Janne Werning, representing Germany’s Union Investment, a top-20 shareholder, said in prepared remarks. About 30 billion euros ($34 billion) have been wiped off Bayer’s market value since August, when a U.S. jury found the pesticide and drugs group liable because Monsanto had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup. Bayer suffered a similar defeat last month and more than 13,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages. Bayer is appealing or plans to appeal the verdicts. Deutsche Bank’s asset managing arm DWS said shareholders should have been consulted before the takeover, which was agreed in 2016 and closed in June last year. “You are pointing out that the lawsuits have not been lost yet. We and our customers, however, have already lost something - money and trust,” Nicolas Huber, head of corporate governance at DWS, said in prepared remarks for the AGM. He said DWS would abstain from the shareholder vote of confidence in the executive and non-executive boards. Two people familiar with the situation told Reuters this week that Bayer’s largest shareholder, BlackRock, plans to either abstain from or vote against ratifying the management board’s actions. Asset management firm Deka, among Bayer’s largest German investors, has also said it would cast a no vote.     Baumann said Bayer’s true value was not reflected in the current share price. “There’s no way to make this look good. The lawsuits and the first verdicts weigh heavily on our company and it’s a concern for many people,” he said, adding it was the right decision to buy Monsanto and that Bayer was vigorously defending itself. This month, shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis recommended investors not to give the executive board their seal of approval.

8618,"  - A Missouri special prosecutor said on Friday she would not bring charges against former Governor Eric Greitens, who resigned last month as he was facing impeachment over an extramarital affair, allegations of blackmail and questionable fundraising. Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker, named in late May as a special prosecutor in the case, said in a statement that after reviewing evidence, she was declining to indict Greitens. St. Louis prosecutors had dismissed the criminal invasion of privacy charge against Greitens on May 14 before his trial got under way. They subsequently said it would be refiled before a decision on whether to proceed was handed to Baker’s office. An attorney for Greitens was not immediately available for comment. Greitens, a 44-year-old former Navy SEAL commando once seen as a rising star in the Republican Party, was suspected of felony invasion of privacy in connection with an admitted extramarital affair in 2015 before he was elected.  He was accused of taking a photo of his lover in a state of undress without her consent and making it accessible by computer to use as retaliation should she divulge their relationship. He has denied threatening to blackmail her and his attorneys have  noted that the alleged photograph has never been produced.  Greitens abruptly resigned on May 29.  St. Louis prosecutors dropped a separate charge of computer tampering stemming from fundraising activities in what appeared to be a deal reached as a part of his departure from office. He had remained under investigation for possible felony invasion of privacy in connection with the extramarital affair. Greitens has called the charges part of a political witch hunt and he has complained of “legal harassment.” ",Missouri prosecutor will not charge scandal-plagued ex-governor,"June 8, 2018 /  10:48 PM ", a missouri special prosecutor said on friday she would not bring charges against former governor eric greitens who resigned last month as he was facing impeachment over an extramarital affair allegations of blackmail and questionable fundraising jackson county prosecutor jean peters baker named in late may as a special prosecutor in the case said in a statement that after reviewing evidence she was declining to indict greitens st louis prosecutors had dismissed the criminal invasion of privacy charge against greitens on may  before his trial got under way they subsequently said it would be refiled before a decision on whether to proceed was handed to baker s office an attorney for greitens was not immediately available for comment greitens a  year old former navy seal commando once seen as a rising star in the republican party was suspected of felony invasion of privacy in connection with an admitted extramarital affair in  before he was elected he was accused of taking a photo of his lover in a state of undress without her consent and making it accessible by computer to use as retaliation should she divulge their relationship he has denied threatening to blackmail her and his attorneys have noted that the alleged photograph has never been produced greitens abruptly resigned on may  st louis prosecutors dropped a separate charge of computer tampering stemming from fundraising activities in what appeared to be a deal reached as a part of his departure from office he had remained under investigation for possible felony invasion of privacy in connection with the extramarital affair greitens has called the charges part of a political witch hunt and he has complained of legal harassment ,Brexit,0.15874986350536346

8683,"WASHINGTON   - The president of Michigan State University, who resigned over a scandal involving a doctor convicted of molesting young female gymnasts, apologized before a U.S. Senate Committee on Tuesday. “I am so sorry that a trusted, renowned physician turned out to be an evil predator, and I am sorry that we did not discover his crimes and remove him from the community sooner,” said Lou Anna Simon, who resigned in January. “Now, my hope is that we learn from these horrific events.” Larry Nassar worked at an on-campus clinic at Michigan State. “Do I wish in hindsight things might have been different?” she added. “I have a lot of wishes about that.”  Simon and Steve Penny, who stepped down as president of USA Gymnastics, have been criticized for not doing enough to halt abuse by Nassar, who worked as a doctor for USA Gymnastics.  Penny, who was subpoenaed to testify, asserted his right under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution not to incriminate himself when asked when he first learned of Nassar’s abuse. “I respectfully decline to answer your question,” Penny said, when asked whether he felt a responsibility to testify. After confirming he planned to plead the Fifth to every question, Penny was excused and a woman in the audience yelled:  “Shame” at him as he exited.  Nassar received prison sentences of up to 175 and 125 years in two Michigan courts, and 60 years in a separate federal case.  Many victims testified in the Michigan cases that Nassar sexually abused them under the guise of medical treatment while on his examination table, sometimes hiding it from view of nearby parents. The disclosures of the long-running abuses sparked investigations by Congress and the U.S. Department of Education into possible offenses at U.S. athletic federations and schools. “There’s developed a culture within the Olympics which prioritized winning medals over the health and welfare of the athletes,” Republican Senator Joni Ernst said at the hearing. The scandal also led to the resignation of the entire USA Gymnastics board, and Scott Blackmun, the head of the U.S. Olympic Committee, who left in February, citing medical reasons.  “I am deeply sorry for those who were harmed and horrified that this happened on my watch,” Blackmun said in a written statement released by the committee.  Last month, hundreds of women sexually abused by Nassar tentatively agreed to a $500 million settlement with Michigan State. Penny resigned in March 2017, saying it was in the best interests of the sport. Kerry Perry, chief executive officer of USA Gymnastics since December, apologized last month to hundreds of female athletes sexually abused by Nassar and told a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee hearing that “those days are over.” A third official, Rhonda Faehn, who was dismissed last month as the women’s program director of USA Gymnastics, testified as she cried at one point that she alerted Penny to complaints about Nassar and believed he would report the abuse to authorities.

8764,"  - Pensions & Investment Research Consultants (PIRC), which advises pension schemes and other investors, recommended on Tuesday that investors in Boeing oppose the re-election of Dennis A. Muilenburg as chairman and chief executive officer. “There should be a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the company between the running of the board and the executive responsibility for the running of the company’s business,” PIRC said. “No one individual should have unfettered powers of decision,” PIRC said, adding that “combining the two roles in one person represents a concentration of power that is potentially detrimental to board balance, effective debate, and board appraisal.” The world’s largest aircraft maker has been battling its biggest crisis in years after its 737 MAX model was grounded worldwide in March following two fatal crashes. The crash of a Lion Air aircraft in Indonesia on Oct. 29 and an Ethiopian Airlines plane on March 10 together killed all 346 people on board.

8936,"LONDON   - Britain is starting its search for a new governor of the Bank of England to succeed Mark Carney who is due to step down in January 2020. Carney has twice extended his term in charge of the British central bank in order to help guide the economy through Brexit. But he has ruled out a further delay even though Britain’s departure from the European Union remains up in the air. Finance minister Philip Hammond is hoping that concerns about Brexit will not deter potential applicants. Following is a summary of possible contenders to run the BoE which oversees the world’s fifth-biggest economy and Britain’s huge finance industry.  A former deputy BoE governor, Bailey was tipped by analysts as Carney’s most likely successor. But the delays to the search for the next BoE governor has raised questions about whether finance minister Philip Hammond sees him as the best candidate. Bailey reached the role of deputy governor at the BoE with a focus on banks before becoming chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, a financial markets regulator. In his time at the BoE, Bailey helped to steer Britain’s banks through the global financial crisis, enhancing his reputation as a safe pair of hands. But heading the FCA is fraught with risks. Lawmakers in parliament’s Treasury Committee criticized Bailey for not publishing all of a report into alleged misconduct by bank RBS. Bailey has cited privacy restrictions. As FCA boss, Bailey sits on important panels at the BoE that oversee banks. Although he has never been interest-rate setter, he once ran the BoE international economic analysis team. Broadbent and Ramsden are deputy governors for monetary policy and for markets and banking respectively. Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs economist who trained as a classical pianist, is respected for his economic analysis but has less experience on banking oversight. Ramsden was the Treasury’s chief economic advisor before joining the BoE. The two other BoE deputy governors, Jon Cunliffe and Sam Woods, are less likely contenders. Woods focuses mostly on financial regulation while Cunliffe - a former British ambassador to the European Union - would be aged 66 at the start of the term which usually runs for eight years. The BoE’s chief economist, Haldane has developed a reputation for floating unconventional ideas, including the possibility that music apps such as Spotify and multiplayer online games might give central bankers just as a good a sense of what is going on in the economy as traditional surveys. In 2012, he praised the anti-capitalist Occupy movement for suggesting new ways to fix the shortcomings of global finance. Haldane has experience of both sides of the BoE, having served as executive director for financial stability, overseeing the risks to the economy from the banking system. But he might be seen as too much of a maverick to take the job of governor. The announcement of Carney, the first non-British governor of the BoE in more than three centuries, was a surprise.  But his tenure has been seen as a success for financial diplomacy, and the government is keen to promote what it calls a “global Britain” after the country leaves the European Union. Rajan, 56, was governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 2013 to 2016, and chief economist at the International Monetary Fund between 2003 and 2006, when he warned that financial innovation could trigger a crisis.     Now a finance professor at Chicago Booth business school, Rajan has just published a book on populist dissatisfaction with markets and the state - touching on some of the underlying issues that drove the Brexit vote in 2016. Rajan unexpectedly did not seek a renewal of his three-year term at the RBI, having faced hostility from some sections of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP party who disliked his less nationalist stance and brief forays into political territory. Rajan declined to comment when asked by Reuters last week whether he would consider a return to active policymaking.  The prospect of the left-wing Labour Party taking power has grown as Prime Minister Theresa May struggles to break the Brexit impasse in parliament. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his would-be finance minister John McDonnell are socialists and have in the past proposed that the BoE should fund investment in infrastructure, a big change from its current focus on inflation.  Former members of Labour’s economic advisory committee included U.S. academic and Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz and Ann Pettifor, a British economist who is an austerity critic and former BoE rate-setter David Blanchflower.

9180,"SYDNEY   - Citigroup is refunding more than A$3 million ($2.2 million) to retail customers in Australia who suffered losses from complex investments sold by the bank without adequate advice, the country’s corporate watchdog said on Monday. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said it had concerns the bank’s financial advisers had sold the complex products without complying with regulatory and disclosure obligations required to provide personal financial advice. Following an investigation by the regulator, Citi will refund 114 customers who invested in complex fixed coupon products and other capital at risk products between 2013 and 2017 and lost money, the regulator said in a statement. The bank will also give customers with remaining investments in the products an opportunity to exit “without cost,” the regulator said. Following ASIC’s investigation, Citi on Jan. 1, 2018, stopped selling structured products to retail clients without adequate personal financial advice, it said. “While Citi maintains the view that none of its actions amounted to a breach of its obligations, Citi has acknowledged ASIC’s concerns and is making a payment to this (small) group of clients,” a Citi spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. The bank confirmed it no longer offers the products to Australian retail investors without taking into account their personal circumstances and providing them with personal advice. It has completed about 75 percent of the refunds, the spokeswoman said. Citi is also defending a lawsuit brought against it by the country’s competition regulator over a 2015 capital raising.

9229,"WASHINGTON   - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said late on Thursday that the chamber’s chaplain will remain in his position, after he unexpectedly asked Reverend Patrick Conroy to resign two weeks ago, outraging some lawmakers and the Jesuit priest himself.  Conroy released a letter earlier on Thursday rescinding his abrupt resignation which Ryan, a Catholic and the top Republican in the House, said he had accepted. Conroy’s last day had been scheduled for May 24. “My original decision was made in what I believed to be the best interest of this institution,” Ryan said in a statement. “To be clear, that decision was based on my duty to ensure that the House has the kind of pastoral services that it deserves. It is my job as speaker to do what is best for this body, and I know that this body is not well served by a protracted fight over such an important post.” It is unusual for House chaplains to be dismissed, and Democrats said the ouster was tied to a prayer Conroy led during debate over the tax overhaul Republicans passed at the end of last year without any support from the minority party. Ryan and fellow Republicans, however, said the lawmakers needed better pastoral care. In his statement, Ryan said he would meet with Conroy next week.

9350,"TOKYO   - Carlos Ghosn’s “illegal” arrest has interrupted his care for chronic kidney failure, which the former Nissan Motor boss suffers from as a result of treatment for high cholesterol, his defense said in documents seen by Reuters on Thursday. Ghosn’s defense team, in documents prepared after their client was arrested for the fourth time by Tokyo prosecutors last week - and the details of which have not been previously reported - allege the latest arrest was designed to interrupt the defense’s preparation and force a confession. Tokyo prosecutors declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Prosecutors re-arrested Ghosn last Thursday at his Tokyo residence where he had been staying since his release on $9 million bail, returning him to the detention center where he previously spent more than 100 days. Authorities arrested Ghosn on suspicion of enriching himself at a cost of $5 million to Nissan, having already charged him for financial misconduct. Before the latest arrest, Ghosn - once one of the world’s most-feted auto executives for his rescue of Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago - denied all allegations against him and said he was the victim of a boardroom coup. “This arrest is illegal,” the defense said in one of the documents, dated April 5, the day after he was re-arrested. Ghosn has high cholesterol and, as a result of treatment, suffers from chronic kidney failure and rhabdomyolysis, the defense said. Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome where muscle fibers release their contents into the blood stream. Interrupting his treatment for the “convenience of prosecutors’ investigation” was “inhuman”, the defense said. The documents also include an account from Ghosn’s wife, Carole, who said prosecutors prevented her from contacting her lawyer on the morning of her husband’s re-arrest. She said she was repeatedly subjected to body checks, forced to keep the bathroom door open when using the toilet, and that a female investigator was present in the bathroom when she undressed to take a shower. “I felt that they were humiliating and coercing me with these inhuman actions,” Carole Ghosn said in her account, dated April 4, the day of her husband’s re-arrest. Following the arrest, Carole Ghosn went to France to seek help from the French government. Her husband is a French, Brazilian and Lebanese national. She has since returned to Japan and on Thursday was questioned by prosecutors at the Tokyo District Court, the Kyodo news agency reported. Prosecutors are questioning Carlos Ghosn for as much as 14 hours a day, sometimes in the middle of the night, said a person with knowledge of the conditions of Ghosn’s detention, and who was not permitted to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified. The development is likely to renew focus on what has been characterized in the West as Japan’s unduly harsh judicial system - a system branded “hostage justice” by critics and defended by local authorities.

9361,"AMSTERDAM   - More than 40 licenses were issued in 2018 to businesses moving to Amsterdam from London due to Britain’s departure from the European Union, the Dutch financial markets regulator said on Thursday. In its 2018 annual report the AFM said it had held discussions with 150 companies and expects 30 to 40 percent of the European stock and bond market to move to the Netherlands in the event of Brexit.

9378,"NEW YORK   - Technology stocks led Wall Street slightly higher on Wednesday, as U.S. inflation data proved to be benign and the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s March meeting were unsurprising.  The blue-chip Dow, held back by industrial stocks, squeaked into positive territory at the closing bell. The three major U.S. indexes were relatively unchanged following the release of the Fed’s minutes, which reaffirmed the central bank’s patience regarding future interest rate hikes.  “The Fed notes were kind of a nothing, exactly what the market was expecting” said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. “It’s how the Fed likes to operate. They wanted to reaffirm existing expectations, which they did.” Core U.S. consumer prices, which strip out volatile food and energy segments, rose at the slowest annual pace in over a year, according to the Labor Department’s CPI report. The tepid inflation data further supported the Fed’s decision to suspend its three-year, interest-rate-hike campaign. “The core number shows no inflation and the headline reflects higher gasoline prices, which is a headwind for growth, a tax on consumers,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.         Top executives from some of the largest U.S. banks testified before Congress for the first time since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, just days before the banks report quarterly results amid lowered expectations by analysts. Profit forecasts for the first quarter have dropped steadily in the last six months, with S&P 500 earnings now seen falling by 2.5%, which would mark the first year-on-year contraction since 2016, according to Refinitiv data. The earnings season began in earnest as Delta Air Lines raised its revenue forecast and posted better-than-expected profits, lifting the airliner’s stock by 1.6%.  Levi Strauss & Co posted a 7% rise in revenue in its first earnings report since returning to the public market. Its shares rose 4.0%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.58 points, or 0.03%, to 26,157.16, the S&P 500 gained 10.01 points, or 0.35%, to 2,888.21, and the Nasdaq Composite added 54.97 points, or 0.69%, to 7,964.24. Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, eight ended the session in positive territory. Boeing Co weighed on industrials as the plane maker’s shares extended losses, closing down 1.1%.  Tesla Inc got a boost after U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation that would expand the electric vehicle tax credit. The company’s stock advanced 1.4%. ConAgra Brands shot up 6.7% after providing upbeat forecasts at its investor day. First Solar Inc jumped 8.3% after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its conviction list. Houseware retailer Bed Bath & Beyond shot up more than 8% in after-market trading after posting quarterly results. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.85-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.26-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 73 new highs and 36 new lows.   Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.15 billion shares, compared to the 7.20 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

9456,"ATLANTA   - Delta Air Lines Inc Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said on Tuesday he was confident U.S. planemaker Boeing Co would resolve issues relating to its 737 MAX jet following two deadly crashes involving that type of aircraft. Delta does not own the MAX, which was flown in the United States by its rivals Southwest Airlines Co, American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines until a global grounding last month following an Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10. That came five months after a similar crash involving Indonesia’s Lion Air. All on board both were killed. The global 737 MAX suspension came as Boeing was moving toward the decision of a decade: whether to launch an all-new jet program with a niche midsized airplane, known so far as the NMA. Boeing’s proposal was aimed at addressing the so-called middle of the jet market, between traditional narrowbody jets with one aisle like the 737 and long-distance widebody planes like the 787. Speaking at an aviation conference in Atlanta, Bastian said Delta was “very interested” in Boeing’s proposed new midsized airplane, though he said the world’s largest planemaker was focusing first on dealing with the crisis surrounding the MAX. Bastian has said that Delta was looking to replace some 200 Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft over the next decade as it seeks to grow internationally. He declined to comment on Tuesday on whether Delta would invest in Italy’s flag carrier Alitalia. The Italian government has been seeking a buyer to save the airline, which was put under special administration in 2017 after a series of failed rescue plans.       Atlanta-based Delta is due to publish first-quarter results on Wednesday. Its shares have surged about 10 percent since the No. 2 U.S. airline raised its first-quarter profit estimate earlier this month on the back of strong business travel demand.

9471,"SAN DIEGO   - San Diego County leaders voted on Tuesday to join the Trump administration’s court challenge to a California law limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, amid a conservative backlash to the so-called sanctuary movement.  The Republican-controlled Board of Supervisors voted to direct the county attorney to file a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the administration’s lawsuit at the first available opportunity, which is likely to be on appeal, board Chair Kristin Gaspar said. The 3-1 vote during a closed-door session, with one of the five supervisors absent, followed an hour-long packed public hearing on the matter. Outside, pro-sanctuary protesters peacefully picketed the meeting, carrying signs with slogans such as “Sanctuary Cities Make Us Safer,” and “We Are All Immigrants.”  The action by leaders of California’s second-largest county followed a similar move last month by the all-Republican board of supervisors for neighboring Orange County, the state’s third-most-populous county. The city council of the tiny Orange County municipality of Los Alamitos went even further on Monday night, approving an ordinance to “exempt” the town of about 12,000 people from the state’s sanctuary law.  The city of San Diego ranks as California’s second-biggest by population, and with the adjacent Mexican city of Tijuana, comprises the largest cross-border metropolitan area shared between the United States and Mexico. California moved to the forefront of political opposition to Republican President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration with enactment last year of the first statewide law aimed at restricting local law enforcement participation in federal deportation activity.  The measure bars state and local authorities from keeping undocumented immigrants who are incarcerated locked up any longer than otherwise necessary for the purpose of allowing U.S. immigration agents to take them into custody. It also prohibits police from routinely inquiring about the immigration status of people detained in an investigation or in traffic stops. But the law, known as SB-54, allows local police to notify the federal government if they have arrested an undocumented immigrant with a felony record and permits immigration agents access to local jails. The Trump administration has harshly criticized California’s law and similar sanctuary ordinances adopted by local governments across the country, saying they threaten public safety by protecting criminals who should to be deported. Sanctuary supporters counter that enlisting police cooperation in deportation actions undermines community trust in local law enforcement, particularly among Latinos, and that Trump’s crackdown has targeted some immigrants over minor infractions. The U.S. Justice Department sued California over SB-54 in February, claiming federal law pre-empts the statute, in a move Democratic Governor Jerry Brown denounced as a declaration of war on his state. Since then, however, local politicians in a number of California’s more conservative cities and counties have pushed back against the sanctuary movement, approving resolutions in support of the Trump administration lawsuit.

9501,"  - Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund Third Point LLC is building a stake in Sony Corp to push for changes that include shedding some businesses, the second time in six years it has targeted the Japanese electronics maker, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Once a market leader in consumer electronics, Sony is now in the midst of a turnaround effort spearheaded by Kenichiro Yoshida, its chief executive who formerly served at its chief financial officer. The maker of the iconic Walkman and Trinitron TV fell behind the likes of Apple Inc in innovation after the release of the iPod in 2001 and the iPhone in 2007. Sony over the past decade has reinvented itself as an entertainment company with stable revenue from music content and its video game platform. Investors are now searching for its next source of growth as Sony’s gaming business shows signs of slowing, with its popular PlayStation 4 console nearing the end of its cycle. Third Point’s amassed stake in Sony thus far could not be learned. The hedge fund, which has about $14.5 billion in assets under management, is raising a dedicated investment vehicle, targeting between $500 million and $1 billion in capital, so it can buy more Sony shares, the sources said. Third Point wants Sony to explore options for some of its business units, including its movie studio, which the hedge fund believes has attracted takeover interest from the likes of Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc, the sources said. The hedge fund also wants clarity on how Sony’s semiconductor and insurance divisions fit in with the rest of the company, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Sony and Third Point declined to comment. U.S.-listed shares of Sony rose 8.3 percent after the Reuters report to close at $46.65. The company, whose main stock market listing is in Tokyo, has a market value of 6.1 trillion yen ($55 billion). Sony reported lower-than-expected profit in February, dragged down by its previously thriving gaming business, even as a one-off gain related to its acquisition of music publisher EMI pushed the quarterly result to a record high. Third Point last exited a stake in Sony in 2014 with a roughly 20 percent gain after spending a year and a half pushing for Sony to spin off its entertainment division, writing in a letter to investors that the division remained “poorly managed.” Some Hollywood actors and producers rallied behind Sony at the time, with actor and producer George Clooney calling Loeb “a hedge fund guy who describes himself as an activist but who knows nothing about our business.” Later Loeb changed his tune, praising the company for cutting costs at the entertainment division and having made management changes. Sony has already sold off its ailing personal computer division and streamlined its television and smartphone businesses. In taking aim at Sony’s commitment to the entertainment business, however, Third Point may be facing an uphill struggle.  Yoshida has said he sees synergies between the film business and its PlayStation platform, and he has been emboldened by Sony’s cinema hits such as ‘Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,’ and ‘Venom’.  Consolidation in the sector has been intensifying amid pressure from online streaming services offered by companies like Netflix and Amazon, and with Walt Disney Co completing its $71.3 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox Inc’s entertainment assets from Rupert Murdoch’s media empire last month.  Loeb is no stranger to challenging companies with long odds of success. Last year, he sought to oust the entire board of Campbell Soup Co, despite the founding family’s members controlling much of the U.S. food company. He ended up settling for two board seats. This is the second time Third Point is looking to increase its firepower by raising a special purpose vehicle. In 2017, it raised $750 million that way to build a stake in Nestle SA.  Sony last month said its chairman Kazuo Hirai, who helped engineer the company’s recent revival, would retire in June.

9502,"CIUDAD JUAREZ/MEXICO CITY   - Long delays at the U.S.-Mexico border crossing for goods destined for American plants and consumers are hitting the U.S. auto industry, and the gridlock reduced by half the number of northbound trucks that crossed the entry point last week. Washington’s decision to move some 750 agents from commercial to immigration duties to handle a surge in families seeking asylum in the United States has triggered the delays at crucial ports on a border that handle $1.7 billion in daily trade. “The situation in Ciudad Juarez is very serious because these auto parts go to plants in the United States and obviously they put at risk the operation in the United States,” Eduardo Solis, the president of the Mexican Auto Industry Association (AMIA), said on Monday. The North American auto industry is highly integrated and many car parts cross the border several times before they are finally installed on a vehicle. Seventeen 17 hours before the crossing to El Paso even opened on  Monday morning, trucks were already lining up in Ciudad Juarez to avoid the fate of some 7,500 trailers that failed to cross last week, said Manuel Sotelo, vice president at the Mexican National Chamber of Freight Transport’s north division. That is roughly half the number of trucks per week that usually cross there, carrying everything from car and plane parts to refrigerators, washing machines, TVs, cellphones and computers. “This is not normal. We had never seen this before in Ciudad Juarez,” said Sotelo. Despite elevated costs, some Mexican exporters are turning to air freight to avoid the mile-long lines at the border. “We’re using charter (planes) which cost between $35,000 and $100,000 depending on the volume and merchandise,” said Pedro Chavira, who heads the manufacturing industry chamber INDEX in Ciudad Juarez.

His comments followed a Washington Post report saying the U.S. government and Facebook were negotiating a multibillion-dollar fine settlement over the company’s privacy lapses. Zuckerberg also called for updated legislation focused on protecting elections, including new rules aimed at online political advertising that “reflect the reality of the threats” faced by social media companies.

10004,"  - A U.S. federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked a Mississippi law that enacted the tightest restrictions on abortion in the United States, in a ruling handed down a day after the governor signed the measure. The Mississippi law would prohibit abortion after 15 weeks of gestation, with some exceptions. It went into effect immediately after Republican Governor Phil Bryant signed it on Monday. State law previously banned abortion at 20 weeks after conception, in line with limits in 17 other states.  The judge’s ruling blocks the measure for 10 days, while he considers arguments on whether to stop the law from taking effect until the outcome of a full legal challenge.   “The Supreme Court says every woman has a constitutional right to ‘personal privacy’ regarding her body,” U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves in Jackson, Mississippi, said in a two-page ruling that quoted from the high court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion. The judge said a stay was justified because the Mississippi law’s proposed 15-week limit is outside of the medical consensus about when fetus becomes vital, raising questions about whether it violates the U.S. Constitution. Abortion rights groups say anti-abortion organizations could use the case to test limits on abortion all the way to the Supreme Court. The court in the past has struck down prohibitions on abortion before fetal viability, usually considered to be about 20 weeks of gestation. The Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the only clinic providing abortions in Mississippi, sued to block the measure on Monday. “We will fight this unconstitutional ban and ensure that women can access legal and safe abortion care, no matter their zip code,” the New York City-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the clinic in court, said in a statement on Twitter after the ruling.  In 2016, the Supreme Court refused to uphold an Arkansas law that banned abortion after 12 weeks’ gestation as well as a North Dakota six-week law. The Mississippi governor called the judge’s ruling on Tuesday disappointing. “House Bill 1510 protects maternal health and will further our efforts to make Mississippi the safest place in America for an unborn child,” Bryant said in a statement. “We are confident in its constitutionality and look forward to vigorously defending it.”  ",Mississippi's new law restricting abortion blocked by judge for 10 days,"March 20, 2018 /  5:11 PM ", a u s federal judge on tuesday temporarily blocked a mississippi law that enacted the tightest restrictions on abortion in the united states in a ruling handed down a day after the governor signed the measure the mississippi law would prohibit abortion after  weeks of gestation with some exceptions it went into effect immediately after republican governor phil bryant signed it on monday state law previously banned abortion at  weeks after conception in line with limits in  other states the judge s ruling blocks the measure for  days while he considers arguments on whether to stop the law from taking effect until the outcome of a full legal challenge the supreme court says every woman has a constitutional right to personal privacy regarding her body u s district court judge carlton reeves in jackson mississippi said in a two page ruling that quoted from the high court s  roe v wade ruling that legalized abortion the judge said a stay was justified because the mississippi law s proposed  week limit is outside of the medical consensus about when fetus becomes vital raising questions about whether it violates the u s constitution abortion rights groups say anti abortion organizations could use the case to test limits on abortion all the way to the supreme court the court in the past has struck down prohibitions on abortion before fetal viability usually considered to be about  weeks of gestation the jackson women s health organization the only clinic providing abortions in mississippi sued to block the measure on monday we will fight this unconstitutional ban and ensure that women can access legal and safe abortion care no matter their zip code the new york city based center for reproductive rights which is representing the clinic in court said in a statement on twitter after the ruling in  the supreme court refused to uphold an arkansas law that banned abortion after  weeks gestation as well as a north dakota six week law the mississippi governor called the judge s ruling on tuesday disappointing house bill  protects maternal health and will further our efforts to make mississippi the safest place in america for an unborn child bryant said in a statement we are confident in its constitutionality and look forward to vigorously defending it ,Brexit,0.1944219470024109
10097,"WASHINGTON   - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday it had initiated an anti-dumping duty and countervailing duty investigation of wooden cabinets and vanities imported from China to determine whether they are being dumped on the U.S. market. The action was taken based on petitions filed by the American Kitchen Cabinet Alliance on March 6. The United States imported some $4.4 billion worth of wooden cabinets, vanities and their components from China in 2018, the department said. If the Commerce Department makes an affirmative finding in the investigations, and if the U.S. International Trade Commission finds that U.S. industry was harmed, the United States would impose duties on the imports in the amount of dumping or unfair subsidization that is taking place. Alleged dumping margins for China range from 177.36 percent to 262.18 percent, the department said.

10312,"  - Philip Morris International Inc on Friday said its Canadian unit, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc (RBH), was granted creditor protection, following a tobacco class action ruling in Quebec this month. The company said it would deconsolidate RBH from its financial statements, and it cut its full-year 2019 diluted earnings per share forecast to at least $4.90 at prevailing exchange rates, from at least $5.28 in the forecast it made on March 4, shortly after the ruling in Quebec.  The Court of Appeal of Quebec upheld the bulk of a 2015 decision that awarded about C$15 billion ($11.19 billion) to smokers in the Canadian province, a blow to several big tobacco companies, including RBH. Some observers criticized the creditor protection calling it an attempt to avoid making payments.  “The company’s strategy is to obtain a sweetheart settlement of all tobacco lawsuits in Canada, and then to carry on business as normal”, said Rob Cunningham, senior policy analyst from the Canadian Cancer Society.  “The company is highly profitable and is not anywhere close to bankruptcy.”   On an adjusted basis, the current forecast for full-year 2019 represents earnings per share growth of at least 8 percent over last year, the Marlboro cigarette maker said. The deconsolidation, which will not have an impact on the company’s current annualized dividend rate, will result in an estimated one-time non-cash charge of about $0.10 per share, it said. The operating cash flow for full-year 2019 is now estimated to be about $9.5 billion, down from “at least $10 billion” in the forecast it made on Feb. 7.  The creditor protection process, granted by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, will allow RBH to carry on its business in the ordinary course, Philip Morris added.

10523,"WASHINGTON   - In a case of reality TV meets Washington, President Donald Trump is bringing television cameras into normally private White House talks with lawmakers that feature sharp debates and, seemingly, policy-making on the fly.   The meetings make Trump look engaged and interested, countering critics who have questioned his mental acuity, but they have done little to advance policy. Democrats, who keep attending despite seeing few actual results, increasingly question whether these sessions are merely a repackaging of Trump’s star turn on The Apprentice, a TV show he hosted for 14 seasons. “It’s always good to talk, but it strikes me as a presidential show more than anything,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who attended a trade meeting with Trump, told Reuters. “The problem is the president agreed with everything everybody said when I was there. We were saying opposite things sometimes,” Brown said. At a meeting about gun laws on Wednesday, Trump presided over a free-wheeling discussion and endorsed stricter gun regulations than Republicans typically support.  So, will that lead to anything? Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat who was present for a similar meeting with Trump about immigration, advised caution. “My advice is hope for the best; don’t be surprised if he changes his mind in 48 hours,” Durbin told reporters on Wednesday. People close to Trump said the idea of opening up such meetings lets him transmit his message directly to the public and contrast his style with that of Republicans and Democrats from Capitol Hill. “He comes out of 15 years of a reality TV show, and part of the show is, you show every aspect of your business activities,” said Chris Ruddy, a Trump friend. “It’s great. He has U.S. senators as his cast.” Still, that cast is aware that the cameras are rolling, which can affect how they behave. “They’re a useful way to make news, they’re not a useful way to negotiate policy,” said Republican strategist Charlie Black about the open discussions, adding that participants were less likely to negotiate seriously on live TV.  A White House official said the decision to open up the typically private meetings was “100 percent Trump.” Trump was pleased when the press stayed for the meeting on immigration and decided, at least for some meetings, to continue the practice. “He loved it, he thought it was fabulous. He said that worked out well, let’s do more of that,” the official said. Since that gathering, Congress has failed to pass any immigration legislation, and Trump’s own legislative proposal was trounced in the Senate. Republican lawmakers, who have had to correct or clarify Trump’s policy positions at such confabs in real time with cameras rolling, like their Democratic colleagues have had to get used to discussing policy positions publicly. Then there is the follow-through.  “The upside is it’s fascinating television. It actually shows Trump in an authentic and real-life situation where he’s trying to hash out policy,” said Republican strategist Ryan Williams, a former spokesman for one-time presidential candidate and current Senate candidate from Utah Mitt Romney. “The downside is they turn into events that are wildly off script from generally accepted Republican Party policy, and he rarely follows up on the items that are discussed in the meetings,” Williams said. Matt Dallek, an associate professor of political management at George Washington University, said the meetings were “fundamentally deceptive” because Trump frequently espouses views in front of the cameras that “he has not held previously and that he does not stick with.” ",Transparency?

10587,"DETROIT   - As Lyft Inc cruises toward an initial public offering this month, one of the big winners will be General Motors Co, whose stake in the ride-hailing firm could be worth as much as $1.27 billion.  GM is not talking about its plans for that investment, and investors polled by Reuters, owning a collective 35.7 million shares, do not have a consensus view.  Some believe the No. 1 U.S. automaker should hold on to it for strategic reasons, while others want the money returned to shareholders through buybacks or a special dividend. “Unless GM can leverage its investment in Lyft to accelerate its own robo-taxi ambitions with Cruise, we believe it would be appropriate to cash out its stake to repurchase its own under-valued shares,” said Michael Razewski, a partner with Douglas C. Lane & Associates, which owned about 2.6 million GM shares at the end of 2018.  Cruise Automation is GM’s self-driving car unit. Lyft on Monday launched the investor “roadshow” for the March 29 IPO, and it said it to sell Class A shares at $62 to $68 a share. GM owns more than 18.6 million Class A shares, according to the Lyft filing, meaning its investment at the outset could be worth $1.16 billion to $1.27 billion. GM invested $500 million in Lyft in January 2016. With a 180-day lock-up period during which GM cannot sell and the expected April IPO of larger rival Uber Technologies Inc further stoking interest in the ride-hailing sector, the value could subsequently rise. GM spokesman Tom Henderson said the automaker is happy with its Lyft stake, but declined to discuss future plans for the shares. Lyft spokeswoman Alexandra LaManna had no comment. Several shareholders would like to see GM sell the stake and use the proceeds to repurchase shares or pay a special dividend. “If I want to buy Lyft, I’ll go do it myself,” said Scott Schermerhorn, managing principal with Granite Investment Advisors, which owns more than 210,000 GM shares. “Take the proceeds and invest it in something that’s core to their business or give it back to shareholders.” However, Jacques Elmaleh, portfolio manager with Steinberg Global Asset Management, with almost 24,000 GM shares at the end of 2018, said it is too early to write off the relationship. “I’d be inclined that they hold onto it and see how it plays out,” he said. Some of GM’s larger investors - the United Auto Workers retiree healthcare benefits trust, hedge fund manager David Einhorn and T. Rowe Price Group Inc - declined to comment. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc did not respond to a request for comment. GM’s former president, Dan Ammann, joined Lyft’s board as the companies eyed developing networks of self-driving cars together. However, there have been few signs of cooperation. Ammann - who now leads Cruise - left the Lyft board in June 2018. Analysts have speculated GM will eventually sell shares in Cruise or spin it off, and the incentive plan disclosed last month for Ammann pointed toward a possible IPO. Kyle Martin, analyst with Westwood Holdings, which owns more than 30,000 GM shares, would just as soon see GM sell the Lyft stake and use that money in Cruise. “That’s a meaningful amount of money that could certainly help them close the gap with Waymo and put them even further ahead of Ford,” he said, referring to technology leader Alphabet’s Waymo and GM rival Ford Motor Co.

10721,"WASHINGTON/FRANKFURT   - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is suing Volkswagen (VW) and its former chief executive Martin Winterkorn over the German automaker’s diesel emissions scandal, alleging a “massive fraud” on U.S. investors. VW was caught using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015, triggering a global backlash against diesel that and has so far cost it 29 billion euros (£24.78 billion). Regulators and investors argue VW should have informed them sooner about the scope of the scandal, while VW says it was not clear it would face billions of dollars in fines and penalties as others had paid out much lower sums for similar offences.  The SEC said in its civil complaint on Thursday that from April 2014 to May 2015, VW issued more than $13 billion in bonds and asset-backed securities in U.S. markets at a time when senior executives knew that more than 500,000 U.S. diesel vehicles grossly exceeded legal vehicle emissions limits. VW “reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in benefit by issuing the securities at more attractive rates for the company,” the SEC said, adding it “repeatedly lied to and misled United States investors, consumers, and regulators as part of an illegal scheme to sell its purportedly ‘clean diesel’ cars and billions of dollars of corporate bonds and other securities in the United States.” The suit filed in San Francisco seeks to bar Winterkorn from serving as an officer or director of a public U.S. company and recover “ill-gotten gains” along with civil penalties and interest. Winterkorn, who resigned days after the scandal became public in September 2015, was charged by U.S. prosecutors in 2018 and accused of conspiring to cover up the German automaker’s diesel emissions cheating.  A lawyer for Winterkorn, who remains in Germany, declined to comment on the SEC action.  VW said in a statement the SEC complaint “is legally and factually flawed, and Volkswagen will contest it vigorously. The SEC has brought an unprecedented complaint over securities sold only to sophisticated investors who were not harmed and received all payments of interest and principal in full and on time.” The automaker added that the SEC “does not charge that any person involved in the bond issuance knew that Volkswagen diesel vehicles did not comply with U.S. emissions rules when these securities were sold” but repeats claims about Winterkorn “who played no part in the sales”. German markets regulator Bafin could not be reached for comment about whether it was working with the SEC.  VW has spent billions to pay claims from United States-based VW owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers, and has offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. That figure included $4.3 billion in U.S. criminal and civil fines. But the SEC said VW “has never repaid the hundreds of millions of dollars in benefit it fraudulently obtained.” VW admitted to secretly installing software in 500,000 U.S. vehicles to cheat government exhaust emissions tests and pleaded guilty in 2017 to felony charges. 13 people have been charged in the United States, including Winterkorn and four Audi managers. The SEC suit also names VW’s VW Credit and Volkswagen Group of America Finance LLC, the entity used to sell the securities. VW also faces investor lawsuits in Braunschweig, Germany. Critics argue that VW should have informed investors on September 3, 2015 about having used a “defeat device” to cheat emissions tests, the same day that VW managers admitted to using illegal software to U.S. regulators.   Investors were informed about VW’s diesel cheating after U.S. regulators blew the whistle on September 18, 2015. VW argues it did not have to inform investors earlier because it did not believe it was facing significant fines.  VW’s management had sought to strike a deal with U.S. regulators behind closed doors, a process that would lead costs to be “controllable overall with a view to the business activities of Volkswagen Group,” a VW document showed. A defence filing made with the Braunschweig court says VW’s chief financial officer was informed that there was a potential problem with United States authorities on September 14, 2015.  At the time, VW believed it could fix polluting vehicles with a software update and gauged the potential financial risk to be around 150 million euros, the Braunschweig document shows.

11553,"  - Conflicting cultures and management styles are overshadowing Barrick Gold Corp’s $18 billion bid for rival Newmont Mining Corp, becoming factors just as important to the deal’s success as whether or not the pair’s lucrative assets in Nevada and elsewhere fit well together. Mudslinging started almost as soon as the hostile all-stock, no-premium bid was announced on Monday. One rival executive compared the tension between Barrick Chief Executive Mark Bristow and Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg to the Hatfields and McCoys, two 19th Century U.S. families whose members held a grudge for generations. “Newmont shareholders shouldn’t risk what they have and need for what they don’t have and don’t need,” Goldberg told Reuters on Friday.  Newmont’s board continues to evaluate Barrick’s offer, Goldberg said. He reiterated what he had said earlier in the week that all options were on the table, including a Newmont bid for Barrick. Bristow was not available for an interview on Friday. At the heart of the debate is Nevada, where Barrick and Newmont have owned neighboring mines since the 1980s. Newmont said it prefers a joint venture in the state, a plan which Barrick says would be too complicated and not financially beneficial to all shareholders. The logic of combining the company’s Nevada assets seems clear to both sides, but the sticking point is control.  “If those fences and armed guards were removed, you’d have trucks from Barrick’s mine not drive hours to get to the crusher and roaster, but they would have to go two miles to Newmont’s,” said an person familiar with Barrick’s thinking. Bristow and Goldberg were emailing each other as recently as late January about a potential Nevada venture before Bristow stopped responding, Goldberg said.  “I was hopeful that Mark, as another miner, would be able to sit down and do a (Nevada joint venture) deal as a point of logic,” said Goldberg. “But then he dropped a hostile, no-premium bid.” Bristow, for his part, said in an interview earlier this week that Goldberg did not show up for recently planned meetings to discuss Nevada. Barrick, which two months ago closed a $6.1 billion buyout of Randgold Resources, has encouraged Newmont to ditch a previously announced $10 billion takeover of Canada’s Goldcorp Inc.  Barrick has historically relied on acquisitions for growth, amassing billions of dollars of debt that it has been working to pay down. Newmont in recent years has focused on organic growth and financial discipline, although the Goldcorp bid breaks with past practice. Those divergent strategies would be hard to meld even in a friendly proposal, but become that much more difficult amid the culture clash, according to multiple investors and bankers, with the acrimony threatening to scuttle the deal as it did when the companies last tried to combine in 2014.  “Newmont will fight to the death to stay independent,” a banking source said. Newmont’s shares have gained 39 percent in the past five years, compared to a 26 percent drop for Barrick’s stock and a 3 percent drop in gold prices.   Some Newmont shareholders question Barrick’s claim that the deal will generate more than $7 billion in synergies.  “We have no reason to have confidence in (Bristow’s) ability to manage such a vastly more-complicated company,” said James Rasteh of Coast Capital Management LP, which said it holds more than 100,000 Newmont shares. Bristow said in an interview earlier this week that his record at Africa-focused Randgold speaks for itself. Some investors agree. “Newmont is a company in need of a shakeup,” said John Ing of Maison Placements, which declined to say how many Barrick shares it holds.  BlackRock, a top-three investor in both companies, declined to comment. Flossbach Von Storch, a large investor in both companies, has said it supports a friendly deal but could not be reached for comment on Friday. Newmont would have to pay Goldcorp a $650 million break-up fee if it pulls its offer.

11787,"WASHINGTON, Feb 22   - The U.S. economy maintained “solid” growth through the second half of 2018, likely expanding “just under” 3 percent for the year, though consumer and business spending had begun to weaken, the Federal Reserve said on Friday in its semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress.    In a document that balanced its mostly positive outlook for a still growing economy against an array of emerging domestic and global risks, the U.S. central bank laid out why it had put further interest rate hikes on hold last month. From a “deteriorated” appetite for risk among investors to a slowdown in China, the outlook for policy is “more uncertain than earlier,” the Fed said, noting “softer global and economic conditions.” That may spill into the start of 2019, the Fed said, noting that the recent 35-day partial shutdown of the U.S. government “likely held down GDP growth in the first quarter of this year.” For 2018, the Fed said: “Consumer spending expanded at a strong rate for most of the second half ... though spending appears to have weakened toward year-end.”  “Business investment grew as well, though growth seems to have slowed somewhat,” it added. Consumer and business confidence remains “favorable,” but “some measures have softened since the fall,” the Fed reported. “Domestic financial conditions for businesses and households have become less supportive of economic growth.” The Fed noted to Congress that it would continue to reduce the size of its balance sheet, which had declined by about $260 billion since its last report to lawmakers, ending the year at close to $4 trillion. But the central bank also repeated its new openness to adjusting “any of the details” of its balance sheet plan if economic and financial conditions warrant. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will testify before lawmakers in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on Tuesday and Wednesday to elaborate on the report in what could prove to be an important week for economic data and the central bank’s sense of where the economy is heading. The report indicated some underlying economic strength, with “ongoing improvements in the labor market,” and solid growth in disposable income, fueled by the Trump administration’s tax cuts, boosting household consumption. Inflation last year remained close to the Fed’s 2 percent target.  But the Fed noted headwinds, including those tied to the ongoing debate over global trade policy. Overall, net exports “likely subtracted a little from real GDP growth” over 2018, despite the administration’s efforts to improve the U.S. trade position.  At a policy meeting late last month, Fed officials put their three-year push for higher interest rates on hold amid a broad recognition that inflation and global growth had weakened, and that the U.S. outlook was less certain than just a few weeks earlier.  Since then, economic data has been mixed, with weaker retail sales and manufacturing reports balanced by continued strong job growth. But some important pieces of the puzzle have been missing altogether. Most notably, the report on gross domestic product for the last quarter of 2018 was delayed by the recent government shutdown. That report is due to be released on Thursday, and will be followed on Friday by the jobs report for February.

11788,"DETROIT   - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said on Tuesday it will invest $4.5 billion in five plants to build new models of Jeeps to compete in the lucrative market for full-size, three-row SUVs currently dominated by rivals General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co. At the same time, the automaker said it was cutting the third shift at its Rockford, Illinois plant, where it assembles the Jeep Cherokee, laying off 1,371 workers. The company said it would “make every effort” to find work for laid off hourly workers based on seniority. The new investments announced on Tuesday will create 6,500 jobs in Michigan, Fiat Chrysler (FCA) said in an announcement about three months after GM said it would not allocate new products to five plants in North America that mostly produce less-popular sedan models. GM workers and politicians, including U.S. President Donald Trump, have blasted GM for the decision, which is likely to close those plants. The move comes at a time when the U.S. market looks set to decline, with 2019 industry-wide new vehicle sales expected to fall below 2018 levels.  But FCA Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley said in a conference call with reporters that the company’s investments are focused on SUVs, an area “forecasted to continue to grow.” He added that 60 percent of SUV sales are for three-row models “and we don’t have a three-row offering... and this is a segment that I’ve been very interested in for some time.”  The full-size SUV segment is dominated by GM’s Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade, which had about double the sales of Ford’s Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator in 2018. FCA’s plans include turning an engine plant in Detroit into an assembly plant. The company also reversed a decision to shift production of heavy-duty trucks from Mexico to Michigan in 2020, freeing the Michigan facility to produce Jeeps. “I look at today’s investment as a reward for the efforts of our membership and a show of confidence that the members of the UAW are the best auto workers in the world,” United Auto Workers union Vice President Cindy Estrada said in a statement.  The automaker said plans included investments to enable three Michigan plants to produce hybrid and fully electric Jeep models. Manley said those hybrid models or electric models could be available as soon as late 2021, but will be rolled out based on consumer demand.  FCA plans to start construction on the new $1.6 billion Detroit facility in the third quarter of 2019 and begin  production of a new three-row SUV by the end of 2020, followed by a revamped version of the Grand Cherokee in the first half of 2021. The plans also include a $900 million investment to modernize and retool another Detroit plant to make the Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee. Those investments come around six years since Detroit filed the largest ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy and will bring nearly 5,000 jobs to the city.  FCA and the city of Detroit have signed a memorandum of understanding that provides 60 days to follow through on the agreed acquisition of land for the new plant.  “This opportunity is unlike anything we have seen in decades,” Detroit mayor Mike Duggan said in a statement, adding that the investments would take place “without displacing a single resident.”  FCA will also start production of its Wagoneer model and the Grand Wagoneer, a new three-row luxury SUV, at a plant in Warren in the first half of 2021. Early last year, FCA said it would move heavy-duty truck production to that plant, but that will now remain in the company’s Saltillo, Mexico, plant. FCA will invest $1.5 billion in the Warren plant - up from $725 million the automaker had not publicly disclosed.

12096,"HOUSTON   - Crude prices rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday to their highest level this year on hopes that oil markets will balance later this year, helped by output cuts from top producers as well as U.S. sanctions on OPEC members Iran and Venezuela. Market fears over trade talks between the United States and China had helped push oil prices lower in early trade, but the market reversed after signs of progress emerged on Wednesday and strengthened equity markets. [.N] U.S. President Donald Trump said negotiations with China were going well and suggested he was open to extending the deadline to complete them beyond March 1, when tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent. “We’re in a market waiting for the next headline to drive us higher or lower,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, adding U.S.-China trade talks are among the issues that market participants have focused on the most.  Brent futures rose 63 cents, or 0.95 percent, to settle at $67.08 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) for delivery in March settled at $56.92 a barrel, up 83 cents, or 1.48 percent, ahead of the contract’s expiry. The more active April contract settled at $57.16, up 71 cents, or 1.38 percent. “The market this week has pushed to three-month highs on expectations of tightened supplies,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “OPEC and Russia are enacting cuts and concerns about reduced Venezuelan exports have helped push markets up.”  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia - an alliance known as OPEC+ - agreed to reduce oil supply by 1.2 million barrels per day from Jan. 1 this year. A monitoring committee for OPEC and its allies found the group’s compliance with its agreement at 83 percent, four delegates told Reuters on Wednesday. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he hoped the oil market would be balanced by April and that there would be no gap in supplies due to U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. “You could take that as a signal that Saudi Arabia will continue to take a proactive approach,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. Some supply disruptions have further tightened supplies. Saudi state oil firm Aramco last week shut part of its Safaniyah offshore oil field after a power cable was inadvertently cut. Production at Libya’s contested El Sharara field has been halted since December. U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have also helped to reduce the availability of crude on the global market.  However, price gains were capped as those supply disruptions were offset by expectations of inventory builds in the United States following a sharp reduction in refineries’ capacity utilization in the U.S. Midwest. U.S. crude stockpiles were expected to have risen by 3.1 million barrels last week, the fifth consecutive weekly build, an extended Reuters poll showed. Inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the main U.S. oil storage hub, will grow largely because U.S. data shows refinery capacity utilization in the Midwest dropped to 84.2 percent from 92.9 percent the previous week, following a string of planned and unplanned outages, analysts said.  “That will leave a lot of barrels on the sidelines,” said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York.  Weekly U.S inventory data is delayed by a day due to the Presidents Day holiday on Monday. The American Petroleum Institute will release its data at 4:30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT), while the U.S. Energy Information Administration report is due on Thursday at 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT). The EIA said on Tuesday shale production alone will hit a record 8.4 million bpd next month, suggesting little chance of a near-term slowdown in overall U.S. crude output. BNP Paribas said surging U.S. output would feed into lower oil prices toward the end of the year, with Brent to dip to an average of $67 by the fourth quarter and WTI to average $61. “U.S. oil production growth, driven by shale, will be increasingly exported in greater volumes to international markets while the global economy is expected to witness a synchronized slowdown in growth,” the bank said.

12122,"OSLO   - Budget carrier Norwegian Air expects to fly a plane out of Iran in the next few days after it made an emergency landing there in December and became stranded, partly due to U.S. sanctions on Tehran. The plane took off from Dubai on Dec. 14 bound for Oslo but had to land in Shiraz in Iran because of problems with one of its engines. The 186 passengers and six crew were able to fly out of Shiraz the next day. But the plane was left behind as it needed spare parts from its manufacturer, U.S. manufacturer Boeing. The Trump administration has reinstated U.S. sanctions on the Middle Eastern country which forbid civilian aircraft sales - including servicing and parts. Any product that contains more than 10 percent of U.S.-origin goods or technology require a U.S. license in order to be sent to Iran. “We are in the process of having a new engine flown to Iran for our Boeing 737 MAX within the next few days,” said a company spokesman.  “It is too early to say exactly when the aircraft will be airborne, but our goal is to fly the aircraft back to Scandinavia within the next week,” he added. Norwegian Air has previously said that the paperwork needed to service the plane had taken longer than usual, partly because the company had to familiarize itself with regulations in Iran, where the firm does not operate. Officials at Shiraz Airport and the Iranian Ministry of Roads and Urban Development could not immediately be reached for comment.

12557,"BERLIN   - Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has thrown his weight behind a proposal to reform Germany’s telecommunications law to toughen security requirements on foreign network vendors, the RND group of newspapers reported on Tuesday. Seehofer’s intervention increases the likelihood that Germany will tighten oversight over Huawei Technologies , sidestepping pressure from the United States to exclude the Chinese company from its market. Government and industry leaders want clarity on the ground rules before Germany embarks on the buildout of next-generation 5G mobile networks by auctioning spectrum in late March. Citing participants at a meeting of conservatives and Social Democrats, who rule together in a grand coalition, RND said Seehofer’s aim was to better control Huawei - and not to ban it. The best way to achieve this would be by amending an article in Germany’s Telecommunications Act that addresses security. This would apply to all vendors and should not be viewed as a direct response to Huawei, coalition sources told RND. Seehofer’s view is key, because his ministry oversees the BSI cybersecurity agency that is drafting a catalog of proposed security steps together with the Federal Network Regulator that will oversee the spectrum auction. Officials are also concerned that, should a decision ultimately be taken to block Huawei, there would need to be a sound legal basis to do so. Consultations are continuing, a senior government source told Reuters earlier on Tuesday, and a final decision on whether to let Chinese firms participate in 5G is unlikely within the next two weeks. Work still needs to be done to address costs, feasibility and security measures, said the source, pushing back against reports in the German business press that officials had hammered out a common approach. NO-SPY DEAL Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Germany needs guarantees that Huawei would not hand data to the Chinese state before it can take part in building fifth-generation networks that would link everything from vehicles to factories at far greater speeds. Such a no-spy pledge would come in addition to a catalog of security measures toughening certification procedures to minimize the risk that network equipment comes fitted with ‘back doors’ that would expose it to cyber espionage. Huawei, the global networks market leader with annual sales exceeding $100 billion, faces international scrutiny over its ties with the Chinese government and suspicion Beijing could use its technology for spying, which the company denies. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo drove home that message in Budapest on Monday, cautioning allies in central Europe that deploying equipment from Huawei would make it more difficult for Washington “to partner alongside them”. Germany’s three telecoms operators - Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone and Telefonica Deutschland - use Huawei equipment in their networks and have warned that curbing their choice of vendors could be costly.  Deutsche Telekom has, for its part, proposed a series of measures to safeguard security, including setting up an independent laboratory to scrutinize equipment used in critical infrastructure before it is deployed in the field.

12700,"NEW YORK   - A U.S. bankruptcy judge on Thursday approved Sears Holdings Corp Chairman Edward Lampert’s $5.2 billion takeover of the beleaguered retailer, allowing the department store chain to avert liquidation and preserve tens of thousands of jobs.  Judge Robert Drain approved the sale after a hearing spanning several days in a White Plains, N.Y., federal bankruptcy court. He overruled objections, including from an unsecured creditors committee, which said the process for selling Sears was unfair to them and argued for a liquidation.  Lampert, who arranged an $11 billion merger between Sears and discounter Kmart in 2005 and tried for years to boost business, wins another chance to try to revive what once was the biggest U.S. retailer. Lampert, the only bidder offering to keep Sears alive through his hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, agreed to a deal for 425 stores after round-the-clock negotiations in January. The takeover aims to preserve about 45,000 jobs. “I conclude that the process here was proper and appropriate,” Drain said in his reasoning for approving the sale. Terms of the sale allow for some litigation to continue against Lampert and ESL.  Drain said Lampert was “subject to substantial verbal abuse” during the proceedings, noting that critics had characterized the Sears chairman in ways that evoked a ruthless robber baron and a blowhard sitcom character. “He is a wealthy individual and a big boy and I guess he can take it,” Drain said, adding that some of the abuse may have been justified. Sears Chief Restructuring Officer Mohsin Meghji and company directors Bill Transier and Alan Carr were among those questioned on a witness stand during the court hearing on Lampert’s offer. Lampert stepped down as CEO when Sears filed for bankruptcy Oct. 15, though he remained the retailer’s chairman, largest shareholder and creditor. A restructuring committee of independent directors negotiated with Lampert and his advisers. Drain grew impatient as the proceedings wore on Thursday. “Give me a break,” the judge said, when a creditors committee lawyer argued an objection to the takeover bid.   Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based Sears will still face fierce competition from big rivals including Amazon.com Inc  and Walmart Inc. Founded in the 19th Century, Sears built itself into an American institution with its famous mail-order catalogs in practically every middle-class home. Its Sears tower in Chicago was once the tallest building in the world. But it failed to adapt to the modern era of online shopping.  When Lampert combined Sears and rival chain Kmart, the merged retailer had nearly 3,500 stores and employed more than 300,000 people, a workforce that shrank to 68,000 when it filed for bankruptcy.   Lampert’s offer came after the retailer had been pushed to the brink of liquidation multiple times. In the end, he boosted his initial offer by $800 million, largely in the assumption of Sears bills for taxes and merchandise.  Money owned to lawyers, bankers and other advisers working on the retailer’s bankruptcy case also proved contentious as Sears lacked enough money to meet all its obligations.  Lampert agreed to take on one of the company’s bankruptcy loans, which debtors typically repay, in its entirety. Lampert was allowed to use $1.3 billion Sears owed him as currency in the offer, a maneuver known as a credit bid, which some creditors had opposed. He received a legal release protecting him from litigation regarding money he loaned Sears.  Lampert still remains exposed to lawsuits related to certain transactions he engaged in while leading Sears before filing for bankruptcy. Sears directors rejected his request to receive a broader legal release covering those deals, which creditors contend robbed them of value.  Sears over the years spun off clothing manufacturer Lands’ End and parted with 235 of its best stores for $2.7 billion to a company Lampert created called Seritage Growth Properties  Drain intervened multiple times to urge Sears advisers and Lampert’s negotiators to keep working toward a deal.

12788,"WASHINGTON   - The top Democrat on a House of Representatives committee  accused its Republican leaders of launching a spurious  investigation of Hillary Clinton to divert attention from inquiries on alleged links between Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. Representative Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on Tuesday wrote to the panel’s chairman, Trey Gowdy, complaining that Republicans had “rushed to launch” an investigation of a purported scandal involving Clinton and Robert Mueller, the special counsel who is investigating allegations about Trump campaign contacts with Russia. “With no consultation with Democrats, you and other Republicans rushed to launch your latest investigation of Secretary Clinton and Mr. Mueller directly after President Trump initiated his own Twitter campaign just days earlier to distract from the ongoing Russia investigations,” Cummings wrote. “This investigation is not - nor will it ever be - about one individual,” Gowdy said in response to a query. “It is about whether or not all pertinent information was known and shared with CFIUS at the time they made their decision and whether the actions of Russia in 2015 and 2016 should cause the U.S. to re-evaluate Russia’s motives in 2010,” he added, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Cummings said Ron DeSantis, the Republican who chairs the oversight committee’s National Security Subcommittee, claimed he interviewed a confidential informant who had helped the FBI uncover a “scheme” to “bribe” then-Secretary of State Clinton to get the interagency committee to approve the sale of a Canadian uranium company to Russia. However, Clinton did not represent the State Department on the foreign investment committee, which approved the sale. Moreover, the major donor to her husband’s Clinton Foundation had sold his stake in Uranium One more than a year before Clinton became secretary of state and three years before Russia’s Rosatom bought the Canadian firm. Cummings said five congressional committees, including the House oversight committee, have investigated the deal and have  “identified no evidence to substantiate allegations that Secretary Clinton orchestrated, manipulated, or otherwise coerced” the interagency committee to approve the deal.     Several Republican members of Congress and some pro-Trump media organizations have demanded that Mueller resign, apparently because he was FBI director when the sale of the uranium company was approved.

13878,"TOKYO   - The Bank of Japan is expected to cut its inflation forecasts at next week’s rate review, sources say, a sign slumping oil prices and a darkening global economic outlook are heightening challenges for hitting its ambitious 2 percent target. But the BoJ is likely to maintain its upbeat assessment that Japan’s economy will keep expanding moderately as global growth is expected to emerge from a soft patch later this year, the sources familiar with the central bank’s thinking, told Reuters. “Oil prices have fallen significantly since the BOJ’s previous projections in October and that will affect its upcoming forecasts,” one of the sources said. “But the underlying trend inflation remains solid,” the source added, a view echoed by three more sources. The central bank is widely expected to keep monetary settings unchanged at its two-day rate review ending on Jan. 23, maintaining a pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and long-term bond yields around zero percent. It will also issue a quarterly report analyzing Japan’s economy that will include fresh growth and inflation forecasts through the fiscal year ending in March 2021. Under the current forecasts made in October, the BOJ expects core consumer inflation to hit 1.4 percent in the fiscal year beginning in April and 1.5 percent the following year. The BoJ’s nine-member board is expected to slightly trim these forecasts to reflect recent declines in oil prices and the potential fallout from slowing global growth, the sources said. The inflation forecast for fiscal 2019 may be cut to around 1 percent, the sources said, still above a 0.7 percent projection made by analysts polled by Reuters. The BoJ is likely to roughly maintain their economic growth projections, as lower energy costs and government spending to mitigate the impact of a scheduled sales tax hike in October offset some of the pain from external headwinds, they said. “Overseas risks are heightening. But they are not huge enough to undermine the BOJ’s forecast of a moderate economic expansion,” one of the sources said. As part of efforts to prevent financial institutions from sitting on their huge pile of cash, the BoJ will also extend the March deadline for a lending scheme aimed at encouraging financial institutions to boost lending, the sources said. Stubbornly low inflation has forced the BoJ to maintain a radical stimulus program despite the rising costs, such as the hit to financial institutions’ profits from years of low rates. Many BOJ policymakers are wary of ramping up stimulus, though external shocks could force the central bank to pull the trigger if the economy is at risk of sliding into recession, analysts say.
